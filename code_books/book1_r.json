In virtue of my office as Assistant Professor in theMuseum of Natural History in Paris, the Fr", "52": "ench Government had attachedme to that expedition. After six months in Nebraska, I arrived in NewYork towards the end of March, ", "53": "laden with a precious collection. Mydeparture for France was fixed for the first days in May. Meanwhile, Iwas occupying myself i", "54": "n classifying my mineralogical, botanical, andzoological riches, when the accident happened to the _Scotia_.I was perfectly up i", "55": "n the subject which was the question of the day.How could I be otherwise? I had read and reread all the American andEuropean pap", "56": "ers without being any nearer a conclusion. This mysterypuzzled me. Under the impossibility of forming an opinion, I jumpedfrom o", "57": "ne extreme to the other. That there really was something couldnot be doubted, and the incredulous were invited to put their fing", "58": "er onthe wound of the _Scotia_.On my arrival at New York the question was at its height. Thehypothesis of the floating island, a", "59": "nd the unapproachable sandbank,supported by minds little competent to form a judgment, was abandoned.And, indeed, unless this sh", "60": "oal had a machine in its stomach, how couldit change its position with such astonishing rapidity?From the same cause, the idea o", "61": "f a floating hull of an enormous wreckwas given up.There remained then only two possible solutions of the question, whichcreated", "62": " two distinct parties: on one side, those who were for a monsterof colossal strength; on the other, those who were for a submari", "63": "nevessel of enormous motive power.But this last hypothesis, plausible as it was, could not stand againstinquiries made in both w", "64": "orlds. That a private gentleman should havesuch a machine at his command was not likely. Where, when, and how wasit built? and h"}, "3": {"1": "ow could its construction have been kept secret?Certainly a Government might possess such a destructive machine. And inthese dis", "2": "astrous times, when the ingenuity of man has multiplied thepower of weapons of war, it was possible that, without the knowledge ", "3": "ofothers, a state might try to work such a formidable engine. After thechassepots came the torpedoes, after the torpedoes the su", "4": "bmarine rams,then\u2014the reaction. At least, I hope so.But the hypothesis of a war machine fell before the declaration ofGovernment", "5": "s. As public interest was in question, and transatlanticcommunications suffered, their veracity could not be doubted. But, howad", "6": "mit that the construction of this submarine boat had escaped thepublic eye? For a private gentleman to keep the secret under suc", "7": "hcircumstances would be very difficult, and for a state whose every actis persistently watched by powerful rivals, certainly imp", "8": "ossible.After inquiries made in England, France, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Italy,and America, even in Turkey, the hypothesis of a ", "9": "submarine monitor wasdefinitely rejected.Upon my arrival in New York several persons did me the honour ofconsulting me on the ph", "10": "enomenon in question. I had published in Francea work in quarto, in two volumes, entitled \u201cMysteries of the GreatSubmarine Groun", "11": "ds.\u201d This book, highly approved of in the learned world,gained for me a special reputation in this rather obscure branch ofNatur", "12": "al History. My advice was asked. As long as I could deny thereality of the fact, I confined myself to a decided negative. But so", "13": "on,finding myself driven into a corner, I was obliged to explain myselfcategorically. And even \u201cthe Honourable Pierre Aronnax, P", "14": "rofessor inthe Museum of Paris,\u201d was called upon by the _New York Herald_ toexpress a definite opinion of some sort. I did somet", "15": "hing. I spoke, forwant of power to hold my tongue. I discussed the question in all itsforms, politically and scientifically; and", "16": " I give here an extract froma carefullystudied article which I published in the number of the 30thof April. It ran as follows:\u2014\u201c", "17": "After examining one by one the different hypotheses, rejecting allother suggestions, it becomes necessary to admit the existence", "18": " of amarine animal of enormous power.\u201cThe great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us. Soundingscannot reach them. What", "19": " passes in those remote depths\u2014what beings live,or can live, twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of thewaters\u2014what is th", "20": "e organisation of these animals, we can scarcelyconjecture. However, the solution of the problem submitted to me maymodify the f", "21": "orm of the dilemma. Either we do know all the varieties ofbeings which people our planet, or we do not. If we do _not_ know them", "22": "all\u2014if Nature has still secrets in ichthyology for us, nothing is moreconformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishe", "23": "s, orcetaceans of other kinds, or even of new species, of an organisationformed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings,", "24": " and which anaccident of some sort, either fatastical or capricious, has brought atlong intervals to the upper level of the ocea", "25": "n.\u201cIf, on the contrary, we _do_ know all living kinds, we mustnecessarily seek for the animal in question amongst those marine b", "26": "eingsalready classed; and, in that case, I should be disposed to admit theexistence of a gigantic narwhal.\u201cThe common narwhal, o", "27": "r unicorn of the sea, often attains a length ofsixty feet. Increase its size fivefold or tenfold, give it strengthproportionate ", "28": "to its size, lengthen its destructive weapons, and youobtain the animal required. It will have the proportions determined bythe ", "29": "officers of the _Shannon_, the instrument required by theperforation of the _Scotia_, and the power necessary to pierce the hull", "30": "of the steamer.\u201cIndeed, the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword, a halberd,according to the expression of certain natura", "31": "lists. The principal tuskhas the hardness of steel. Some of these tusks have been found buriedin the bodies of whales, which the", "32": " unicorn always attacks with success.Others have been drawn out, not without trouble, from the bottoms ofships, which they had p", "33": "ierced through and through, as a gimlet piercesa barrel. The Museum of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris possesses oneof these de", "34": "fensive weapons, two yards and a quarter in length, andfifteen inches in diameter at the base.\u201cVery well! suppose this weapon to", "35": " be six times stronger and the animalten times more powerful; launch it at the rate of twenty miles an hour,and you obtain a sho", "36": "ck capable of producing the catastrophe required.Until further information, therefore, I shall maintain it to be aseaunicorn of ", "37": "colossal dimensions, armed not with a halberd, but witha real spur, as the armoured frigates, or the \u2018rams\u2019 of war, whosemassive", "38": "ness and motive power it would possess at the same time. Thusmay this puzzling phenomenon be explained, unless there be somethin", "39": "gover and above all that one has ever conjectured, seen, perceived, orexperienced; which is just within the bounds of possibilit", "40": "y.\u201dThese last words were cowardly on my part; but, up to a certain point,I wished to shelter my dignity as Professor, and not gi", "41": "ve too muchcause for laughter to the Americans, who laugh well when they do laugh.I reserved for myself a way of escape. In effe", "42": "ct, however, I admittedthe existence of the \u201cmonster.\u201d My article was warmly discussed, whichprocured it a high reputation. It r", "43": "allied round it a certain number ofpartisans. The solution it proposed gave, at least, full liberty to theimagination. The human", "44": " mind delights in grand conceptions ofsupernatural beings. And the sea is precisely their best vehicle, theonly medium through w", "45": "hich these giants (against which terrestrialanimals, such as elephants or rhinoceroses, are as nothing) can beproduced or develo", "46": "ped.The industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly fromthis point of view. The _Shipping and Mercantile Gazet", "47": "te_, the _Lloyd\u2019sList_, the _PacketBoat_, and the _Maritime and Colonial Review_, allpapers devoted to insurance companies which", "48": " threatened to raise theirrates of premium, were unanimous on this point. Public opinion had beenpronounced. The United States w", "49": "ere the first in the field; and in NewYork they made preparations for an expedition destined to pursue thisnarwhal. A frigate of", "50": " great speed, the _Abraham Lincoln_, was put incommission as soon as possible. The arsenals were opened to CommanderFarragut, wh", "51": "o hastened the arming of his frigate; but, as it alwayshappens, the moment it was decided to pursue the monster, the monsterdid ", "52": "not appear. For two months no one heard it spoken of. No ship metwith it. It seemed as if this unicorn knew of the plots weaving", "53": " aroundit. It had been so much talked of, even through the Atlantic cable,that jesters pretended that this slender fly had stopp", "54": "ed a telegram onits passage and was making the most of it.So when the frigate had been armed for a long campaign, and providedwi", "55": "th formidable fishing apparatus, no one could tell what course topursue. Impatience grew apace, when, on the 2nd of July, they l", "56": "earnedthat a steamer of the line of San Francisco, from California toShanghai, had seen the animal three weeks before in the Nor", "57": "th PacificOcean. The excitement caused by this news was extreme. The ship wasrevictualled and well stocked with coal.Three hours", "58": " before the _Abraham Lincoln_ left Brooklyn pier, I receiveda letter worded as follows:\u2014\u201cTo M.

TheCaptain showed me a sketch that gave the pla", "43": "n, section, and elevationof the _Nautilus_. Then he began his description in these words:\u2014\u201cHere, M. Aronnax, are the several dim", "44": "ensions of the boat you are in.It is an elongated cylinder with conical ends.

It is notbuilt quite like your longvoyage steamers, but its lines aresufficiently lon", "47": "g, and its curves prolonged enough, to allow the waterto slide off easily, and oppose no obstacle to its passage. These twodimen", "48": "sions enable you to obtain by a simple calculation the surface andcubic contents of the _Nautilus_. Its area measures 6032 feet;", "49": " and itscontents about 1500 cubic yards\u2014that is to say, when completelyimmersed it displaces 50,000 feet of water, or weighs 150", "50": "0 tons.\u201cWhen I made the plans for this submarine vessel, I meant thatninetenths should be submerged: consequently, it ought only", "51": " todisplace ninetenths of its bulk\u2014that is to say, only to weigh thatnumber of tons. I ought not, therefore, to have exceeded th", "52": "at weight,constructing it on the aforesaid dimensions.\u201cThe _Nautilus_ is composed of two hulls, one inside, the otheroutside, jo", "53": "ined by Tshaped irons, which render it very strong. Indeed,owing to this cellular arrangement it resists like a block, as if itw", "54": "ere solid. Its sides cannot yield; it coheres spontaneously, and notby the closeness of its rivets; and the homogenity of its co", "55": "nstruction,due to the perfect union of the materials, enables it to defy theroughest seas.\u201cThese two hulls are composed of steel", "56": " plates, whose density is from .7to .8 that of water.

The engine, theballast, the several", "58": " accessories and apparatus appendages, thepartitions and bulkheads, weigh 961.62 tons. Do you follow all this?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d\u201cThen, whe", "59": "n the _Nautilus_ is afloat under these circumstances,onetenth is out of the water.

There is very little labour spent in attainin", "3": "gthe lower regions of the ocean, for all bodies have a tendency to sink.When I wanted to find out the necessary increase of weig", "4": "ht required tosink the _Nautilus_, I had only to calculate the reduction of volumethat seawater acquires according to the depth.", "5": "\u201d\u201cThat is evident.\u201d\u201cNow, if water is not absolutely incompressible, it is at least capableof very slight compression. Indeed, af", "6": "ter the most recent calculationsthis reduction is only .000436 of an atmosphere for each thirty feet ofdepth. If we want to sink", "7": " 3000 feet, I should keep account of thereduction of bulk under a pressure equal to that of a column of waterof a thousand feet.", "8": " The calculation is easily verified.

Besides I use subsidiary reservoirs only to attain amean depth of 750 to 1000 fathoms, and that with a view of managing", "18": " mymachines. Also, when I have a mind to visit the depths of the oceanfive or six miles below the surface, I make use of slower ", "19": "but not lessinfallible means.\u201d\u201cWhat are they, Captain?\u201d\u201cThat involves my telling you how the _Nautilus_ is worked.\u201d\u201cI am impatie", "20": "nt to learn.\u201d\u201cTo steer this boat to starboard or port, to turn\u2014in a word, followinga horizontal plan, I use an ordinary rudder f", "21": "ixed on the back of thesternpost, and with one wheel and some tackle to steer by.

There remained nothing more to b", "5": "e done but toenclose our heads in the metal box. But before proceeding to thisoperation, I asked the Captain\u2019s permission to exa", "6": "mine the guns we wereto carry.One of the _Nautilus_ men gave me a simple gun, the butt end of which,made of steel, hollow in the", "7": " centre, was rather large. It served as areservoir for compressed air, which a valve, worked by a spring,allowed to escape into ", "8": "a metal tube. A box of projectiles, in a groovein the thickness of the butt end, contained about twenty of theseelectric balls, ", "9": "which, by means of a spring, were forced into thebarrel of the gun. As soon as one shot was fired, another was ready.\u201cCaptain Ne", "10": "mo,\u201d said I, \u201cthis arm is perfect, and easily handled: Ionly ask to be allowed to try it.

I felt the cold mountfrom ", "21": "my feet to my chest. Evidently from some part of the vessel theyhad, by means of a tap, given entrance to the water, which was i", "22": "nvadingus, and with which the room was soon filled. A second door cut in theside of the _Nautilus_ then opened. We saw a faint l", "23": "ight. In anotherinstant our feet trod the bottom of the sea.And now, how can I retrace the impression left upon me by that walku", "24": "nder the waters? Words are impotent to relate such wonders! CaptainNemo walked in front, his companion followed some steps behin", "25": "d. Conseiland I remained near each other, as if an exchange of words had beenpossible through our metallic cases.

He looked upon it as hisown, and considered he had the same right over it that the firs", "9": "t menhad in the first days of the world. And, indeed, who would havedisputed with him the possession of this submarine property?", "10": " What otherhardier pioneer would come, hatchet in hand, to cut down the darkcopses?This forest was composed of large treeplants;", "11": " and the moment wepenetrated under its vast arcades, I was struck by the singularposition of their branches\u2014a position I had not", "12": " yet observed.Not a herb which carpeted the ground, not a branch which clothed thetrees, was either broken or bent, nor did they", "13": " extend horizontally; allstretched up to the surface of the ocean. Not a filament, not a ribbon,however thin they might be, but ", "14": "kept as straight as a rod of iron. Thefuci and llianas grew in rigid perpendicular lines, due to the densityof the element which", "15": " had produced them. Motionless, yet when bent toone side by the hand, they directly resumed their former position.Truly it was t", "16": "he region of perpendicularity!I soon accustomed myself to this fantastic position, as well as to thecomparative darkness which s", "17": "urrounded us. The soil of the forest seemedcovered with sharp blocks, difficult to avoid. The submarine florastruck me as being ", "18": "very perfect, and richer even than it would havebeen in the arctic or tropical zones, where these productions are notso plentifu", "19": "l. But for some minutes I involuntarily confounded thegenera, taking zoophytes for hydrophytes, animals for plants; and whowould", "20": " not have been mistaken? The fauna and the flora are too closelyallied in this submarine world.These plants are selfpropagated, ", "21": "and the principle of their existenceis in the water, which upholds and nourishes them. The greater number,instead of leaves, sho", "22": "t forth blades of capricious shapes, comprisedwithin a scale of colours,\u2014pink, carmine, green, olive, fawn, andbrown. I saw ther", "23": "e (but not dried up, as our specimens of the_Nautilus_ are) pavonari spread like a fan, as if to catch the breeze;scarlet cerami", "24": "es, whose laminaries extended their edible shoots offernshaped nereocysti, which grow to a height of fifteen feet;clusters of ac", "25": "etabuli, whose stems increase in size upwards; andnumbers of other marine plants, all devoid of flowers!\u201cCurious anomaly, fantas", "26": "tic element!\u201d said an ingenious naturalist, \u201cinwhich the animal kingdom blossoms, and the vegetable does not!\u201dUnder these numero", "27": "us shrubs (as large as trees of the temperate zone),and under their damp shadow, were massed together real bushes of livingflowe", "28": "rs, hedges of zoophytes, on which blossomed some zebrameandrines,with crooked grooves, some yellow caryophylli\u00e6; and, to complet", "29": "e theallusion, the fishflies flew from branch to branch like a swarm ofhummingbirds, whilst yellow lepisacomthi, with bristling ", "30": "jaws,dactylopteri, and monocentrides rose at our feet like a flight ofsnipes.In about an hour Captain Nemo gave the signal to ha", "31": "lt. I, for my part,was not sorry, and we stretched ourselves under an arbour of alari\u00e6,the long thin blades of which stood up li", "32": "ke arrows.This short rest seemed delicious to me; there was nothing wanting butthe charm of conversation; but, impossible to spe", "33": "ak, impossible toanswer, I only put my great copper head to Conseil\u2019s. I saw the worthyfellow\u2019s eyes glistening with delight, an", "34": "d to show his satisfaction, heshook himself in his breastplate of air in the most comical way in theworld.After four hours of th", "35": "is walking I was surprised not to find myselfdreadfully hungry. How to account for this state of the stomach I couldnot tell. Bu", "36": "t instead I felt an insurmountable desire to sleep, whichhappens to all divers. And my eyes soon closed behind the thickglasses,", "37": " and I fell into a heavy slumber, which the movement alone hadprevented before. Captain Nemo and his robust companion, stretched", "38": " inthe clear crystal, set us the example.How long I remained buried in this drowsiness I cannot judge; but, whenI woke, the sun ", "39": "seemed sinking towards the horizon. Captain Nemo hadalready risen, and I was beginning to stretch my limbs, when anunexpected ap", "40": "parition brought me briskly to my feet.A few steps off, a monstrous seaspider, about thirtyeight incheshigh, was watching me wit", "41": "h squinting eyes, ready to spring upon me.Though my diver\u2019s dress was thick enough to defend me from the bite ofthis animal, I c", "42": "ould not help shuddering with horror. Conseil and thesailor of the _Nautilus_ awoke at this moment. Captain Nemo pointed outthe ", "43": "hideous crustacean, which a blow from the butt end of the gunknocked over, and I saw the horrible claws of the monster writhe in", "44": "terrible convulsions. This accident reminded me that other animals moreto be feared might haunt these obscure depths, against wh", "45": "ose attacks mydivingdress would not protect me. I had never thought of it before,but I now resolved to be upon my guard. Indeed,", "46": " I thought that thishalt would mark the termination of our walk; but I was mistaken, for,instead of returning to the _Nautilus_,", "47": " Captain Nemo continued his boldexcursion. The ground was still on the incline, its declivity seemed tobe getting greater, and t", "48": "o be leading us to greater depths. It musthave been about three o\u2019clock when we reached a narrow valley, betweenhigh perpendicul", "49": "ar walls, situated about seventyfive fathoms deep.Thanks to the perfection of our apparatus, we were fortyfive fathomsbelow the ", "50": "limit which nature seems to have imposed on man as to hissubmarine excursions.I say seventyfive fathoms, though I had no instrum", "51": "ent by which tojudge the distance. But I knew that even in the clearest waters thesolar rays could not penetrate further. And ac", "52": "cordingly the darknessdeepened. At ten paces not an object was visible. I was groping my way,when I suddenly saw a brilliant whi", "53": "te light. Captain Nemo had just puthis electric apparatus into use; his companion did the same, andConseil and I followed their ", "54": "example. By turning a screw I establisheda communication between the wire and the spiral glass, and the sea, litby our four lant", "55": "erns, was illuminated for a circle of thirtysix yards.Captain Nemo was still plunging into the dark depths of the forest,whose t", "56": "rees were getting scarcer at every step. I noticed thatvegetable life disappeared sooner than animal life. The medus\u00e6 hadalready", "57": " abandoned the arid soil, from which a great number of animals,zoophytes, articulata, molluscs, and fishes, still obtained suste", "58": "nance.As we walked, I thought the light of our Ruhmkorff apparatus could notfail to draw some inhabitant from its dark couch. Bu", "59": "t if they didapproach us, they at least kept at a respectful distance from thehunters. Several times I saw Captain Nemo stop, pu", "60": "t his gun to hisshoulder, and after some moments drop it and walk on. At last, afterabout four hours, this marvellous excursion ", "61": "came to an end. A wall ofsuperb rocks, in an imposing mass, rose before us, a heap of giganticblocks, an enormous, steep granite", "62": " shore, forming dark grottos, butwhich presented no practicable slope; it was the prop of the Island ofCrespo. It was the earth!", "63": " Captain Nemo stopped suddenly. A gesture ofhis brought us all to a halt, and, however desirous I might be to scalethe wall, I w", "64": "as obliged to stop. Here ended Captain Nemo\u2019s domains. Andhe would not go beyond them. Further on was a portion of the globe hem"}, "23": {"1": "ight not trample upon.The return began. Captain Nemo had returned to the head of his littleband, directing their course without ", "2": "hesitation. I thought we were notfollowing the same road to return to the _Nautilus_. The new road wasvery steep, and consequent", "3": "ly very painful. We approached the surface ofthe sea rapidly. But this return to the upper strata was not so suddenas to cause r", "4": "elief from the pressure too rapidly, which might haveproduced serious disorder in our organisation, and brought on internallesio", "5": "ns, so fatal to divers. Very soon light reappeared and grew, andthe sun being low on the horizon, the refraction edged the diffe", "6": "rentobjects with a spectral ring. At ten yards and a half deep, we walkedamidst a shoal of little fishes of all kinds, more nume", "7": "rous than thebirds of the air, and also more agile; but no aquatic game worthy of ashot had as yet met our gaze, when at that mo", "8": "ment I saw the Captainshoulder his gun quickly, and follow a moving object into the shrubs.He fired;\u2014I heard a slight hissing, a", "9": "nd a creature fell stunned at somedistance from us. It was a magnificent seaotter, an enhydrus, the onlyexclusively marine quadr", "10": "uped. This otter was five feet long, and musthave been very valuable. Its skin, chestnutbrown above and silveryunderneath, would", "11": " have made one of those beautiful furs so sought afterin the Russian and Chinese markets; the fineness and the lustre of itscoat", "12": " would certainly fetch \u00a380. I admired this curious mammal, with itsrounded head ornamented with short ears, its round eyes, and ", "13": "whitewhiskers like those of a cat, with webbed feet and nails, and tuftedtail. This precious animal, hunted and tracked by fishe", "14": "rmen, has nowbecome very rare, and taken refuge chiefly in the northern parts of thePacific, or probably its race would soon bec", "15": "ome extinct.Captain Nemo\u2019s companion took the beast, threw it over his shoulder,and we continued our journey. For one hour a pla", "16": "in of sand laystretched before us. Sometimes it rose to within two yards and someinches of the surface of the water. I then saw ", "17": "our image clearlyreflected, drawn inversely, and above us appeared an identical groupreflecting our movements and our actions; i", "18": "n a word, like us in everypoint, except that they walked with their heads downward and their feetin the air.Another effect I not", "19": "iced, which was the passage of thick clouds whichformed and vanished rapidly; but on reflection I understood that theseseeming c", "20": "louds were due to the varying thickness of the reeds at thebottom, and I could even see the fleecy foam which their broken topsm", "21": "ultiplied on the water, and the shadows of large birds passing aboveour heads, whose rapid flight I could discern on the surface", "22": " of thesea.On this occasion, I was witness to one of the finest gunshots whichever made the nerves of a hunter thrill. A large b", "23": "ird of great breadthof wing, clearly visible, approached, hovering over us. Captain Nemo\u2019scompanion shouldered his gun and fired", "24": ", when it was only a few yardsabove the waves. The creature fell stunned, and the force of its fallbrought it within the reach o", "25": "f the dexterous hunter\u2019s grasp. It was analbatross of the finest kind.Our march had not been interrupted by this incident. For t", "26": "wo hours wefollowed these sandy plains, then fields of alg\u00e6 very disagreeable tocross. Candidly, I could do no more when I saw a", "27": " glimmer of light,which, for a half mile, broke the darkness of the waters. It was thelantern of the _Nautilus_. Before twenty m", "28": "inutes were over we should beon board, and I should be able to breathe with ease, for it seemed thatmy reservoir supplied air ve", "29": "ry deficient in oxygen. But I did notreckon on an accidental meeting, which delayed our arrival for sometime.I had remained some", "30": " steps behind, when I presently saw Captain Nemocoming hurriedly towards me. With his strong hand he bent me to theground, his c", "31": "ompanion doing the same to Conseil. At first I knew notwhat to think of this sudden attack, but I was soon reassured by seeingth", "32": "e Captain lie down beside me, and remain immovable.I was stretched on the ground, just under the shelter of a bush ofalg\u00e6, when,", "33": " raising my head, I saw some enormous mass, castingphosphorescent gleams, pass blusteringly by.My blood froze in my veins as I r", "34": "ecognised two formidable sharks whichthreatened us. It was a couple of tintoreas, terrible creatures, withenormous tails and a d", "35": "ull glassy stare, the phosphorescent matterejected from holes pierced around the muzzle. Monstrous brutes! whichwould crush a wh", "36": "ole man in their iron jaws. I did not know whetherConseil stopped to classify them; for my part, I noticed their silverbellies, ", "37": "and their huge mouths bristling with teeth, from a veryunscientific point of view, and more as a possible victim than as anatura", "38": "list.Happily the voracious creatures do not see well. They passed withoutseeing us, brushing us with their brownish fins, and we", "39": " escaped by amiracle from a danger certainly greater than meeting a tiger fullfacein the forest. Half an hour after, guided by t", "40": "he electric light, wereached the _Nautilus_. The outside door had been left open, andCaptain Nemo closed it as soon as we had en", "41": "tered the first cell. Hethen pressed a knob. I heard the pumps working in the midst of thevessel, I felt the water sinking from ", "42": "around me, and in a few momentsthe cell was entirely empty. The inside door then opened, and weentered the vestry.There our divi", "43": "ngdress was taken off, not without some trouble; and,fairly worn out from want of food and sleep. I returned to my room, ingreat", "44": " wonder at this surprising excursion at the bottom of the sea.CHAPTER XVIIFOUR THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE PACIFICThe next mornin", "45": "g, the 18th of November, I had quite recovered from myfatigues of the day before, and I went up on to the platform, just asthe s", "46": "econd lieutenant was uttering his daily phrase.I was admiring the magnificent aspect of the ocean when Captain Nemoappeared. He ", "47": "did not seem to be aware of my presence, and began aseries of astronomical observations. Then, when he had finished, hewent and ", "48": "leant on the cage of the watchlight, and gazed abstractedlyon the ocean. In the meantime, a number of the sailors of the_Nautilu", "49": "s_, all strong and healthy men, had come up onto the platform.They came to draw up the nets that had been laid all night. Theses", "50": "ailors were evidently of different nations, although the European typewas visible in all of them. I recognised some unmistakable", "51": " Irishmen,Frenchmen, some Sclaves, and a Greek, or a Candiote. They were civil,and only used that odd language among themselves,", "52": " the origin of which Icould not guess, neither could I question them.The nets were hauled in. They were a large kind of \u201cchaluts", "53": ",\u201d likethose on the Normandy coasts, great pockets that the waves and a chainfixed in the smaller meshes kept open. These pocket", "54": "s, drawn by ironpoles, swept through the water, and gathered in everything in theirway. That day they brought up curious specime", "55": "ns from those productivecoasts.I reckoned that the haul had brought in more than nine hundredweight offish. It was a fine haul, ", "56": "but not to be wondered at. Indeed, the netsare let down for several hours, and enclose in their meshes an infinitevariety. We ha", "57": "d no lack of excellent food, and the rapidity of the_Nautilus_ and the attraction of the electric light could always renewour su", "58": "pply. These several productions of the sea were immediatelylowered through the panel to the steward\u2019s room, some to be eatenfres", "59": "h, and others pickled.The fishing ended, the provision of air renewed, I thought that the_Nautilus_ was about to continue its su", "60": "bmarine excursion, and waspreparing to return to my room, when, without further preamble, theCaptain turned to me, saying:\u201cProfe", "61": "ssor, is not this ocean gifted with real life? It has its tempersand its gentle moods. Yesterday it slept as we did, and now it ", "62": "has wokeafter a quiet night. Look!\u201d he continued, \u201cit wakes under the caressesof the sun. It is going to renew its diurnal exist", "63": "ence. It is aninteresting study to watch the play of its organisation.

Yet who knowswhether some despot\u2014\u2014\u201dCaptain Nemo finished ", "5": "his sentence with a violent gesture. Then,addressing me as if to chase away some sorrowful thought:\u201cM. Aronnax,\u201d he asked, \u201cdo y", "6": "ou know the depth of the ocean?\u201d\u201cI only know, Captain, what the principal soundings have taught us.\u201d\u201cCould you tell me them, so ", "7": "that I can suit them to my purpose?\u201d\u201cThese are some,\u201d I replied, \u201cthat I remember. If I am not mistaken, adepth of 8,000 yards h", "8": "as been found in the North Atlantic, and 2,500yards in the Mediterranean. The most remarkable soundings have beenmade in the Sou", "9": "th Atlantic, near the thirtyfifth parallel, and theygave 12,000 yards, 14,000 yards, and 15,000 yards. To sum up all, it isrecko", "10": "ned that if the bottom of the sea were levelled, its mean depthwould be about one and threequarter leagues.\u201d\u201cWell, Professor,\u201d r", "11": "eplied the Captain, \u201cwe shall show you better thanthat I hope. As to the mean depth of this part of the Pacific, I tellyou it is", "12": " only 4,000 yards.\u201dHaving said this, Captain Nemo went towards the panel, and disappeareddown the ladder. I followed him, and we", "13": "nt into the large drawingroom.The screw was immediately put in motion, and the log gave twenty milesan hour.During the days and ", "14": "weeks that passed, Captain Nemo was very sparing ofhis visits. I seldom saw him. The lieutenant pricked the ship\u2019s courseregular", "15": "ly on the chart, so I could always tell exactly the route of the_Nautilus_.Nearly every day, for some time, the panels of the dr", "16": "awingroom wereopened, and we were never tired of penetrating the mysteries of thesubmarine world.The general direction of the _N", "17": "autilus_ was southeast, and it keptbetween 100 and 150 yards of depth. One day, however, I do not knowwhy, being drawn diagonall", "18": "y by means of the inclined planes, it touchedthe bed of the sea. The thermometer indicated a temperature of 4.25(cent.): a tempe", "19": "rature that at this depth seemed common to alllatitudes.At three o\u2019clock in the morning of the 26th of November the _Nautilus_cr", "20": "ossed the tropic of Cancer at 172\u00b0 long. On 27th instant it sightedthe Sandwich Islands, where Cook died, February 14, 1779. We ", "21": "had thengone 4,860 leagues from our startingpoint. In the morning, when I wenton the platform, I saw two miles to windward, Hawa", "22": "ii, the largest ofthe seven islands that form the group. I saw clearly the cultivatedranges, and the several mountainchains that", "23": " run parallel with theside, and the volcanoes that overtop MounaRea, which rise 5,000 yardsabove the level of the sea. Besides o", "24": "ther things the nets brought up,were several flabellariae and graceful polypi, that are peculiar tothat part of the ocean. The d", "25": "irection of the _Nautilus_ was still tothe southeast. It crossed the equator December 1, in 142\u00b0 long.; andon the 4th of the sam", "26": "e month, after crossing rapidly and withoutanything in particular occurring, we sighted the Marquesas group. Isaw, three miles o", "27": "ff, Martin\u2019s peak in NoukaHiva, the largest of thegroup that belongs to France. I only saw the woody mountains againstthe horizo", "28": "n, because Captain Nemo did not wish to bring the ship to thewind. There the nets brought up beautiful specimens of fish: some w", "29": "ithazure fins and tails like gold, the flesh of which is unrivalled; somenearly destitute of scales, but of exquisite flavour; o", "30": "thers, with bonyjaws, and yellowtinged gills, as good as bonitos; all fish that wouldbe of use to us. After leaving these charmi", "31": "ng islands protected by theFrench flag, from the 4th to the 11th of December the _Nautilus_ sailedover about 2,000 miles.During ", "32": "the daytime of the 11th of December I was busy reading in thelarge drawingroom. Ned Land and Conseil watched the luminous watert", "33": "hrough the halfopen panels. The _Nautilus_ was immovable. While itsreservoirs were filled, it kept at a depth of 1,000 yards, a ", "34": "regionrarely visited in the ocean, and in which large fish were seldom seen.I was then reading a charming book by Jean Mace, The", "35": " Slaves of theStomach, and I was learning some valuable lessons from it, when Conseilinterrupted me.\u201cWill master come here a mom", "36": "ent?\u201d he said, in a curious voice.\u201cWhat is the matter, Conseil?\u201d\u201cI want master to look.\u201dI rose, went, and leaned on my elbows be", "37": "fore the panes and watched.In a full electric light, an enormous black mass, quite immovable, wassuspended in the midst of the w", "38": "aters. I watched it attentively, seekingto find out the nature of this gigantic cetacean. But a sudden thoughtcrossed my mind. \u201c", "39": "A vessel!\u201d I said, half aloud.\u201cYes,\u201d replied the Canadian, \u201ca disabled ship that has sunkperpendicularly.\u201dNed Land was right; we", "40": " were close to a vessel of which the tatteredshrouds still hung from their chains. The keel seemed to be in goodorder, and it ha", "41": "d been wrecked at most some few hours.

This skeleton of what it h", "43": "adonce been was a sad spectacle as it lay lost under the waves, butsadder still was the sight of the bridge, where some corpses,", "44": " boundwith ropes, were still lying. I counted five\u2014four men, one of whom wasstanding at the helm, and a woman standing by the po", "45": "op, holding aninfant in her arms. She was quite young.

As long as it went through more frequented waters, ", "55": "we often sawthe hulls of shipwrecked vessels that were rotting in the depths, anddeeper down cannons, bullets, anchors, chains, ", "56": "and a thousand otheriron materials eaten up by rust. However, on the 11th of December wesighted the Pomotou Islands, the old \u201cda", "57": "ngerous group\u201d of Bougainville,that extend over a space of 500 leagues at E.S.E. to W.N.W., from theIsland Ducie to that of Laza", "58": "reff. This group covers an area of 370square leagues, and it is formed of sixty groups of islands, amongwhich the Gambier group ", "59": "is remarkable, over which France exercisessway. These are coral islands, slowly raised, but continuous, createdby the daily work", "60": " of polypi. Then this new island will be joined lateron to the neighboring groups, and a fifth continent will stretch fromNew Ze", "61": "aland and New Caledonia, and from thence to the Marquesas.One day, when I was suggesting this theory to Captain Nemo, he replied", "62": "coldly:\u201cThe earth does not want new continents, but new men.\u201dChance had conducted the _Nautilus_ towards the Island ofClermontTo", "63": "nnere, one of the most curious of the group, that wasdiscovered in 1822 by Captain Bell of the Minerva.

The speed of the_Nautilus_ was considerably abated, and with irregular course shesometimes swam in the bosom of the wa", "7": "ters, sometimes floated on theirsurface.During this period of the voyage, Captain Nemo made some interestingexperiments on the v", "8": "aried temperature of the sea, in different beds.Under ordinary conditions these observations are made by means ofrather complica", "9": "ted instruments, and with somewhat doubtful results, bymeans of thermometrical soundingleads, the glasses often breakingunder th", "10": "e pressure of the water, or an apparatus grounded on thevariations of the resistance of metals to the electric currents.Results ", "11": "so obtained could not be correctly calculated.

", "23": "I was mistaken, and after arapid survey perceived my error.The _Nautilus_ floated in the midst of a phosphorescent bed which, in", "24": "this obscurity, became quite dazzling. It was produced by myriads ofluminous animalculae, whose brilliancy was increased as they", "25": " glidedover the metallic hull of the vessel.

Then appeared the smallerfish, the balista, the leaping mackerel, wolfthorntails, and ahundred o", "35": "thers which striped the luminous atmosphere as they swam.

But on thisday it was exchanged for another phrase not less incomprehensible.Almost directly, I saw Captain Nemo a", "45": "ppear with a glass, lookingtowards the horizon.For some minutes he was immovable, without taking his eye off the pointof observa", "46": "tion. Then he lowered his glass and exchanged a few wordswith his lieutenant. The latter seemed to be a victim to some emotionth", "47": "at he tried in vain to repress. Captain Nemo, having more commandover himself, was cool. He seemed, too, to be making some objec", "48": "tions towhich the lieutenant replied by formal assurances. At least I concludedso by the difference of their tones and gestures.", "49": " For myself, I hadlooked carefully in the direction indicated without seeing anything.The sky and water were lost in the clear l", "50": "ine of the horizon.However, Captain Nemo walked from one end of the platform to the other,without looking at me, perhaps without", "51": " seeing me. His step was firm,but less regular than usual. He stopped sometimes, crossed his arms,and observed the sea. What cou", "52": "ld he be looking for on that immenseexpanse?The _Nautilus_ was then some hundreds of miles from the nearest coast.The lieutenant", "53": " had taken up the glass and examined the horizonsteadfastly, going and coming, stamping his foot and showing morenervous agitati", "54": "on than his superior officer. Besides, this mystery mustnecessarily be solved, and before long; for, upon an order from CaptainN", "55": "emo, the engine, increasing its propelling power, made the screw turnmore rapidly.Just then the lieutenant drew the Captain\u2019s at", "56": "tention again. The latterstopped walking and directed his glass towards the place indicated. Helooked long. I felt very much puz", "57": "zled, and descended to thedrawingroom, and took out an excellent telescope that I generallyused. Then, leaning on the cage of th", "58": "e watchlight that jutted out fromthe front of the platform, set myself to look over all the line of thesky and sea.But my eye wa", "59": "s no sooner applied to the glass than it was quicklysnatched out of my hands.I turned round. Captain Nemo was before me, but I d", "60": "id not know him. Hisface was transfigured. His eyes flashed sullenly; his teeth were set;his stiff body, clenched fists, and hea", "61": "d shrunk between his shoulders,betrayed the violent agitation that pervaded his whole frame. He didnot move. My glass, fallen fr", "62": "om his hands, had rolled at his feet.Had I unwittingly provoked this fit of anger? Did this incomprehensibleperson imagine that ", "63": "I had discovered some forbidden secret? No; I wasnot the object of this hatred, for he was not looking at me; his eyewas steadil", "64": "y fixed upon the impenetrable point of the horizon. At lastCaptain Nemo recovered himself. His agitation subsided. He addresseds"}, "33": {"1": "ome words in a foreign language to his lieutenant, then turned to me.\u201cM.

I went down to the cabin occupied by Ned Land and ", "5": "Conseil, andtold them the Captain\u2019s determination. You may judge how thiscommunication was received by the Canadian.But there wa", "6": "s not time for altercation. Four of the crew waited at thedoor, and conducted us to that cell where we had passed our first nigh", "7": "ton board the _Nautilus_.Ned Land would have remonstrated, but the door was shut upon him.\u201cWill master tell me what this means?\u201d", "8": " asked Conseil.I told my companions what had passed. They were as much astonished asI, and equally at a loss how to account for ", "9": "it.Meanwhile, I was absorbed in my own reflections, and could think ofnothing but the strange fear depicted in the Captain\u2019s cou", "10": "ntenance. Iwas utterly at a loss to account for it, when my cogitations weredisturbed by these words from Ned Land:\u201cHallo! break", "11": "fast is ready.\u201dAnd indeed the table was laid. Evidently Captain Nemo had given thisorder at the same time that he had hastened t", "12": "he speed of the_Nautilus_.\u201cWill master permit me to make a recommendation?\u201d asked Conseil.\u201cYes, my boy.\u201d\u201cWell, it is that master", "13": " breakfasts.

The meal was eaten in silence.Just then the lu", "16": "minous globe that lighted the cell went out, and leftus in total darkness. Ned Land was soon asleep, and what astonished mewas t", "17": "hat Conseil went off into a heavy slumber. I was thinking whatcould have caused his irresistible drowsiness, when I felt my brai", "18": "nbecoming stupefied. In spite of my efforts to keep my eyes open, theywould close. A painful suspicion seized me. Evidently sopo", "19": "rificsubstances had been mixed with the food we had just taken. Imprisonmentwas not enough to conceal Captain Nemo\u2019s projects fr", "20": "om us, sleep wasmore necessary. I then heard the panels shut.

I tried to resist sle", "22": "ep. It was impossible. My breathinggrew weak. I felt a mortal cold freeze my stiffened and halfparalysedlimbs. My eyelids, like ", "23": "leaden caps, fell over my eyes. I could notraise them; a morbid sleep, full of hallucinations, bereft me of mybeing. Then the vi", "24": "sions disappeared, and left me in completeinsensibility.CHAPTER XXIIITHE CORAL KINGDOMThe next day I woke with my head singularl", "25": "y clear. To my greatsurprise, I was in my own room.

I wenton to the pl", "29": "atform.Ned Land and Conseil waited there for me. I questioned them; they knewnothing. Lost in a heavy sleep in which they had be", "30": "en totallyunconscious, they had been astonished at finding themselves in theircabin.As for the _Nautilus_, it seemed quiet and m", "31": "ysterious as ever. Itfloated on the surface of the waves at a moderate pace. Nothing seemedchanged on board.The second lieutenan", "32": "t then came on to the platform, and gave the usualorder below.As for Captain Nemo, he did not appear.Of the people on board, I o", "33": "nly saw the impassive steward, who served mewith his usual dumb regularity.About two o\u2019clock, I was in the drawingroom, busied i", "34": "n arranging mynotes, when the Captain opened the door and appeared.

He made none.", "36": " I looked at him. He seemed fatigued;his heavy eyes had not been refreshed by sleep; his face looked verysorrowful. He walked to", "37": " and fro, sat down and got up again, took achance book, put it down, consulted his instruments without taking hishabitual notes,", "38": " and seemed restless and uneasy.

At halfpast eight we wereequipped for this new ex", "4": "cursion, and provided with two contrivances forlight and breathing. The double door was open; and, accompanied byCaptain Nemo, w", "5": "ho was followed by a dozen of the crew, we set foot, ata depth of about thirty feet, on the solid bottom on which the_Nautilus_ ", "6": "rested.A slight declivity ended in an uneven bottom, at fifteen fathoms depth.This bottom differed entirely from the one I had v", "7": "isited on my firstexcursion under the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Here, there was nofine sand, no submarine prairies, no seafor", "8": "est. I immediatelyrecognised that marvellous region in which, on that day, the Captaindid the honours to us. It was the coral ki", "9": "ngdom.The light produced a thousand charming varieties, playing in the midstof the branches that were so vividly coloured.

I was tempted to gather their fresh", "11": " petals, ornamented withdelicate tentacles, some just blown, the others budding, while a smallfish, swimming swiftly, touched th", "12": "em slightly, like flights of birds.But if my hand approached these living flowers, these animated,sensitive plants, the whole co", "13": "lony took alarm. The white petalsreentered their red cases, the flowers faded as I looked, and the bushchanged into a block of s", "14": "tony knobs.Chance had thrown me just by the most precious specimens of thezoophyte.

We passed freelyunder their high branches, lost in the shade of the wa", "26": "ves.Captain Nemo had stopped. I and my companions halted, and, turninground, I saw his men were forming a semicircle round their", "27": " chief.Watching attentively, I observed that four of them carried on theirshoulders an object of an oblong shape.We occupied, in", "28": " this place, the centre of a vast glade surrounded bythe lofty foliage of the submarine forest. Our lamps threw over thisplace a", "29": " sort of clear twilight that singularly elongated the shadows onthe ground. At the end of the glade the darkness increased, and ", "30": "wasonly relieved by little sparks reflected by the points of coral.Ned Land and Conseil were near me. We watched, and I thought ", "31": "I wasgoing to witness a strange scene. On observing the ground, I saw thatit was raised in certain places by slight excrescences", "32": " encrusted withlimy deposits, and disposed with a regularity that betrayed the hand ofman.In the midst of the glade, on a pedest", "33": "al of rocks roughly piled up,stood a cross of coral that extended its long arms that one might havethought were made of petrifie", "34": "d blood. Upon a sign from Captain Nemo oneof the men advanced; and at some feet from the cross he began to dig ahole with a pick", "35": "axe that he took from his belt. I understood all! Thisglade was a cemetery, this hole a tomb, this oblong object the body ofthe ", "36": "man who had died in the night! The Captain and his men had come tobury their companion in this general restingplace, at the bott", "37": "om ofthis inaccessible ocean!The grave was being dug slowly; the fish fled on all sides while theirretreat was being thus distur", "38": "bed; I heard the strokes of the pickaxe,which sparkled when it hit upon some flint lost at the bottom of thewaters. The hole was", "39": " soon large and deep enough to receive the body.Then the bearers approached; the body, enveloped in a tissue of whitelinen, was ", "40": "lowered into the damp grave.

Then the funeralprocession returned to the _Nautilus_, passin", "44": "g under the arches of theforest, in the midst of thickets, along the coral bushes, and still onthe ascent. At last the light of ", "45": "the ship appeared, and its luminoustrack guided us to the _Nautilus_.

The firstended with the moving scene in the coral cemetery which left such adeep impression o", "53": "n my mind. Thus, in the midst of this great sea,Captain Nemo\u2019s life was passing, even to his grave, which he hadprepared in one ", "54": "of its deepest abysses. There, not one of the ocean\u2019smonsters could trouble the last sleep of the crew of the _Nautilus_, ofthos", "55": "e friends riveted to each other in death as in life. \u201cNor any man,either,\u201d had added the Captain. Still the same fierce, implaca", "56": "bledefiance towards human society!I could no longer content myself with the theory which satisfiedConseil.That worthy fellow per", "57": "sisted in seeing in the Commander of the_Nautilus_ one of those unknown _savants_ who return mankind contemptfor indifference. F", "58": "or him, he was a misunderstood genius who, tired ofearth\u2019s deceptions, had taken refuge in this inaccessible medium, wherehe mig", "59": "ht follow his instincts freely. To my mind, this explains but oneside of Captain Nemo\u2019s character. Indeed, the mystery of that l", "60": "astnight during which we had been chained in prison, the sleep, and theprecaution so violently taken by the Captain of snatching", "61": " from my eyesthe glass I had raised to sweep the horizon, the mortal wound of theman, due to an unaccountable shock of the _Naut", "62": "ilus_, all put me on anew track. No; Captain Nemo was not satisfied with shunning man. Hisformidable apparatus not only suited h", "63": "is instinct of freedom, butperhaps also the design of some terrible retaliation.At this moment nothing is clear to me; I catch b", "64": "ut a glimpse of lightamidst all the darkness, and I must confine myself to writing as eventsshall dictate.That day, the 24th of "}, "35": {"1": "January, 1868, at noon, the second officer cameto take the altitude of the sun. I mounted the platform, lit a cigar,and watched ", "2": "the operation.

When the _Nautilus_ was ready to continue its submarinejourney, I went dow", "11": "n to the saloon. The panel was closed, and thecourse marked direct west.We were furrowing the waters of the Indian Ocean, a vast", "12": " liquid plain,with a surface of 1,200,000,000 of acres, and whose waters are so clearand transparent that any one leaning over t", "13": "hem would turn giddy.

Some were cleverly killed and, prepared in a certain way, madevery", "18": " acceptable watergame. Amongst largewinged birds, carried a longdistance from all lands and resting upon the waves from the fati", "19": "gue oftheir flight, I saw some magnificent albatrosses, uttering discordantcries like the braying of an ass, and birds belonging", "20": " to the family ofthe longwings.As to the fish, they always provoked our admiration when we surprisedthe secrets of their aquatic", "21": " life through the open panels. I saw manykinds which I never before had a chance of observing.I shall notice chiefly ostracions ", "22": "peculiar to the Red Sea, the IndianOcean, and that part which washes the coast of tropical America. Thesefishes, like the tortoi", "23": "se, the armadillo, the seahedgehog, and theCrustacea, are protected by a breastplate which is neither chalky norstony, but real ", "24": "bone. In some it takes the form of a solid triangle, inothers of a solid quadrangle.

Her masts were visible", "63": " for an instant, but she could not seethe _Nautilus_, being too low in the water. I fancied this steamboatbelonged to the P. O.

During the day aformidable tr", "12": "oop of sharks accompanied us, terrible creatures, whichmultiply in these seas and make them very dangerous.

At fir", "23": "st sight the ocean seemed lactified.Was it the effect of the lunar rays? No; for the moon, scarcely twodays old, was still lying", "24": " hidden under the horizon in the rays of thesun. The whole sky, though lit by the sidereal rays, seemed black bycontrast with th", "25": "e whiteness of the waters.Conseil could not believe his eyes, and questioned me as to the causeof this strange phenomenon.

The soilchanged by degrees. To the fine sand succeeded a perf", "21": "ect causeway ofboulders, covered with a carpet of molluscs and zoophytes. Amongst thespecimens of these branches I noticed some ", "22": "placenae, with thin unequalshells, a kind of ostracion peculiar to the Red Sea and the IndianOcean; some orange lucinae with rou", "23": "nded shells; rockfish three feet anda half long, which raised themselves under the waves like hands readyto seize one. There wer", "24": "e also some panopyres, slightly luminous; andlastly, some oculines, like magnificent fans, forming one of therichest vegetations", "25": " of these seas.In the midst of these living plants, and under the arbours of thehydrophytes, were layers of clumsy articulates, ", "26": "particularly someraninae, whose carapace formed a slightly rounded triangle; and somehorrible looking parthenopes.At about seven", "27": " o\u2019clock we found ourselves at last surveying theoysterbanks on which the pearloysters are reproduced by millions.Captain Nemo p", "28": "ointed with his hand to the enormous heap of oysters; andI could well understand that this mine was inexhaustible, for Nature\u2019sc", "29": "reative power is far beyond man\u2019s instinct of destruction.

Wemust follow the Captain, who seemed to guide himsel", "31": "f by paths knownonly to himself. The ground was sensibly rising, and sometimes, onholding up my arm, it was above the surface of", "32": " the sea. Then the levelof the bank would sink capriciously. Often we rounded high rocksscarped into pyramids. In their dark fra", "33": "ctures huge crustacea, perchedupon their high claws like some warmachine, watched us with fixedeyes, and under our feet crawled ", "34": "various kinds of annelides.At this moment there opened before us a large grotto dug in apicturesque heap of rocks and carpeted w", "35": "ith all the thick warp of thesubmarine flora. At first it seemed very dark to me. The solar raysseemed to be extinguished by suc", "36": "cessive gradations, until its vaguetransparency became nothing more than drowned light. Captain Nemoentered; we followed. My eye", "37": "s soon accustomed themselves to thisrelative state of darkness. I could distinguish the arches springingcapriciously from natura", "38": "l pillars, standing broad upon their granitebase, like the heavy columns of Tuscan architecture. Why had ourincomprehensible gui", "39": "de led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt? Iwas soon to know. After descending a rather sharp declivity, our feettrod the ", "40": "bottom of a kind of circular pit. There Captain Nemo stopped,and with his hand indicated an object I had not yet perceived. It w", "41": "asan oyster of extraordinary dimensions, a gigantic tridacne, a gobletwhich could have contained a whole lake of holywater, a ba", "42": "sin thebreadth of which was more than two yards and a half, and consequentlylarger than that ornamenting the saloon of the _Naut", "43": "ilus_. I approachedthis extraordinary mollusc. It adhered by its filaments to a table ofgranite, and there, isolated, it develop", "44": "ed itself in the calm waters ofthe grotto. I estimated the weight of this tridacne at 600 lbs. Such anoyster would contain 30 lb", "45": "s. of meat; and one must have the stomach ofa Gargantua to demolish some dozens of them.Captain Nemo was evidently acquainted wi", "46": "th the existence of thisbivalve, and seemed to have a particular motive in verifying the actualstate of this tridacne. The shell", "47": "s were a little open; the Captain camenear and put his dagger between to prevent them from closing; then withhis hand he raised ", "48": "the membrane with its fringed edges, which formed acloak for the creature. There, between the folded plaits, I saw a loosepearl,", "49": " whose size equalled that of a coconut. Its globular shape,perfect clearness, and admirable lustre made it altogether a jewel of", "50": "inestimable value. Carried away by my curiosity, I stretched out myhand to seize it, weigh it, and touch it; but the Captain sto", "51": "pped me,made a sign of refusal, and quickly withdrew his dagger, and the twoshells closed suddenly. I then understood Captain Ne", "52": "mo\u2019s intention. Inleaving this pearl hidden in the mantle of the tridacne he was allowingit to grow slowly. Each year the secret", "53": "ions of the mollusc would addnew concentric circles. I estimated its value at \u00a3500,000 at least.After ten minutes Captain Nemo s", "54": "topped suddenly. I thought he hadhalted previously to returning. No; by a gesture he bade us crouchbeside him in a deep fracture", "55": " of the rock, his hand pointed to one partof the liquid mass, which I watched attentively.About five yards from me a shadow appe", "56": "ared, and sank to the ground. Thedisquieting idea of sharks shot through my mind, but I was mistaken;and once again it was not a", "57": " monster of the ocean that we had anythingto do with.It was a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, Isupp", "58": "ose, had come to glean before the harvest.

A stone held between his feet, cut in the shape of asugar loaf, whilst a rope fastened him to his boat, helpe", "60": "d him todescend more rapidly. This was all his apparatus.

Then he went up, emptied it, pulled up hisstone, and began the operation once more", "62": ", which lasted thirty seconds.The diver did not see us. The shadow of the rock hid us from sight. Andhow should this poor Indian", "63": " ever dream that men, beings like himself,should be there under the water watching his movements and losing nodetail of the fish", "64": "ing? Several times he went up in this way, and divedagain.

And how many of those oysters for which he ris", "2": "kedhis life had no pearl in them!

A gigantic shadow appeared just above theunfortunate diver. It was a shark of enormous size advancingdiagonally, his e", "6": "yes on fire, and his jaws open.

We", "41": " were upset over one another, and I knownot how the adventure would have ended, if the Canadian, still enragedwith the beast, ha", "42": "d not struck it to the heart.I heard its teeth grind on the iron plate, and the dugong disappeared,carrying the harpoon with him", "43": ".

Indeed, the prec", "19": "eding year, the royal housesof Holland, Austria, and England had concluded a treaty of alliance atthe Hague, with the intention ", "20": "of plucking the crown of Spain from thehead of Philip V, and placing it on that of an archduke to whom theyprematurely gave the ", "21": "title of Charles III.\u201cSpain must resist this coalition; but she was almost entirelyunprovided with either soldiers or sailors. H", "22": "owever, money would notfail them, provided that their galleons, laden with gold and silverfrom America, once entered their ports", "23": ". And about the end of 1702 theyexpected a rich convoy which France was escorting with a fleet oftwentythree vessels, commanded ", "24": "by Admiral ChateauRenaud, for theships of the coalition were already beating the Atlantic. This convoywas to go to Cadiz, but th", "25": "e Admiral, hearing that an English fleet wascruising in those waters, resolved to make for a French port.\u201cThe Spanish commanders", "26": " of the convoy objected to this decision.

At about halfpast eleven the reservoirs were emptied, and ourvessel rose to the surfac", "14": "e of the ocean. I rushed towards the platform.Ned Land had preceded me. No more land in sight. Nothing but an immensesea. Some s", "15": "ails on the horizon, doubtless those going to San Roque insearch of favourable winds for doubling the Cape of Good Hope. Theweat", "16": "her was cloudy.

Captain Nemohad not even proposed my taking with me eith", "29": "er Ned or Conseil.In a few moments we had put on our divingdresses; they placed on ourbacks the reservoirs, abundantly filled wi", "30": "th air, but no electric lampswere prepared.

I had taken my place withConseil in the saloon; through the open window we could see the lowerbed", "18": "s of the Southern Ocean. The thermometer went up, the needle of thecompass deviated on the dial. At about 900 feet, as Captain N", "19": "emo hadforeseen, we were floating beneath the undulating bottom of theiceberg. But the _Nautilus_ went lower still\u2014it went to th", "20": "e depth offour hundred fathoms.

From 67\u00b0 30\u2032 to 90deg., twentytwo degrees and a half of latitude remained to travel;that is, about five hundred", "25": " leagues. The _Nautilus_ kept up a meanspeed of twentysix miles an hour\u2014the speed of an express train. Ifthat was kept up, in fo", "26": "rty hours we should reach the pole.For a part of the night the novelty of the situation kept us at thewindow. The sea was lit wi", "27": "th the electric lantern; but it was deserted;fishes did not sojourn in these imprisoned waters; they only foundthere a passage t", "28": "o take them from the Antarctic Ocean to the open polarsea. Our pace was rapid; we could feel it by the quivering of the longstee", "29": "l body. About two in the morning I took some hours\u2019 repose, andConseil did the same. In crossing the waist I did not meet Captai", "30": "nNemo: I supposed him to be in the pilot\u2019s cage. The next morning, the19th of March, I took my post once more in the saloon.

My heart beat fast. Were we going to emerge and regain theopen polar atmosphere? No! A shock t", "33": "old me that the _Nautilus_ hadstruck the bottom of the iceberg, still very thick, judging from thedeadened sound.

This would give threethousand feet of i", "35": "ce above us; one thousand being above the watermark.The iceberg was then higher than at its borders\u2014not a very reassuringfact. S", "36": "everal times that day the _Nautilus_ tried again, and every timeit struck the wall which lay like a ceiling above it.

We made for it, but carefully, for the sea might bestrewn with banks. One hour afterwards we had reached it, two hourslater", "56": " we had made the round of it.

From this fact hehas drawn the conclusion that the An", "60": "tarctic Circle enclosesconsiderable continents, as icebergs cannot form in open sea, but onlyon the coasts. According to these c", "61": "alculations, the mass of icesurrounding the southern pole forms a vast cap, the circumference ofwhich must be, at least, 2,500 m", "62": "iles. But the _Nautilus_, for fear ofrunning aground, had stopped about three cablelengths from a strandover which reared a supe", "63": "rb heap of rocks. The boat was launched; theCaptain, two of his men, bearing instruments, Conseil, and myself werein it. It was ", "64": "ten in the morning. I had not seen Ned Land.

For along way the soil was composed of a reddish sandy stone, something likecrushed brick, scoriae, streams of lava, and pumic", "8": "estones. One couldnot mistake its volcanic origin.

I found Capt", "32": "ain Nemo there.\u201cThe weather is lightening a little,\u201d said he. \u201cI have some hope.

After all, I was not sorry for hisobstinacy under the circumsta", "35": "nces. Indeed, there were too many seals onshore, and we ought not to lay such temptation in this unreflectingfisherman\u2019s way. Br", "36": "eakfast over, we went on shore. The _Nautilus_ hadgone some miles further up in the night. It was a whole league from thecoast, ", "37": "above which reared a sharp peak about five hundred yards high.The boat took with me Captain Nemo, two men of the crew, and thein", "38": "struments, which consisted of a chronometer, a telescope, and abarometer.

I", "44": " also noticed large medus\u00e6 floating between the reeds.At nine we landed; the sky was brightening, the clouds were flying tothe s", "45": "outh, and the fog seemed to be leaving the cold surface of thewaters. Captain Nemo went towards the peak, which he doubtless mea", "46": "nt tobe his observatory. It was a painful ascent over the sharp lava and thepumicestones, in an atmosphere often impregnated wit", "47": "h a sulphuroussmell from the smoking cracks. For a man unaccustomed to walk on land,the Captain climbed the steep slopes with an", "48": " agility I never sawequalled and which a hunter would have envied. We were two hoursgetting to the summit of this peak, which wa", "49": "s half porphyry and halfbasalt. From thence we looked upon a vast sea which, towards the north,distinctly traced its boundary li", "50": "ne upon the sky. At our feet layfields of dazzling whiteness.

Behind us, to the southand east, a", "53": "n immense country and a chaotic heap of rocks and ice, thelimits of which were not visible. On arriving at the summit CaptainNem", "54": "o carefully took the mean height of the barometer, for he would haveto consider that in taking his observations. At a quarter to", "55": " twelve thesun, then seen only by refraction, looked like a golden disc sheddingits last rays upon this deserted continent and s", "56": "eas which never man hadyet ploughed. Captain Nemo, furnished with a lenticular glass which, bymeans of a mirror, corrected the r", "57": "efraction, watched the orb sinkingbelow the horizon by degrees, following a lengthened diagonal. I heldthe chronometer. My heart", "58": " beat fast. If the disappearance of thehalfdisc of the sun coincided with twelve o\u2019clock on the chronometer,we were at the pole ", "59": "itself.\u201cTwelve!\u201d I exclaimed.\u201cThe South Pole!\u201d replied Captain Nemo, in a grave voice, handing methe glass, which showed the orb", "60": " cut in exactly equal parts by thehorizon.I looked at the last rays crowning the peak, and the shadows mountingby degrees up its", "61": " slopes.

I gr", "15": "opedalong the partition, and by the staircase to the saloon, which was litby the luminous ceiling. The furniture was upset.

As I was leaving ", "19": "the saloon, Ned Land and Conseilentered.\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d said I, at once.\u201cI came to ask you, sir,\u201d replied Conseil.\u201cConfoun", "20": "d it!\u201d exclaimed the Canadian, \u201cI know well enough!

There was no one in the library. At the cen", "25": "trestaircase, by the berths of the ship\u2019s crew, there was no one. Ithought that Captain Nemo must be in the pilot\u2019s cage. It was", "26": " best towait. We all returned to the saloon. For twenty minutes we remainedthus, trying to hear the slightest noise which might ", "27": "be made on boardthe _Nautilus_, when Captain Nemo entered. He seemed not to see us; hisface, generally so impassive, showed sign", "28": "s of uneasiness. He watchedthe compass silently, then the manometer; and, going to theplanisphere, placed his finger on a spot r", "29": "epresenting the southernseas. I would not interrupt him; but, some minutes later, when heturned towards me, I said, using one of", "30": " his own expressions in theTorres Straits:\u201cAn incident, Captain?\u201d\u201cNo, sir; an accident this time.\u201d\u201cSerious?\u201d\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\u201cIs the da", "31": "nger immediate?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThe _Nautilus_ has stranded?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd this has happened\u2014how?\u201d\u201cFrom a caprice of nature, not from the ign", "32": "orance of man. Not a mistakehas been made in the working. But we cannot prevent equilibrium fromproducing its effects. We may br", "33": "ave human laws, but we cannot resistnatural ones.\u201dCaptain Nemo had chosen a strange moment for uttering thisphilosophical reflec", "34": "tion. On the whole, his answer helped me little.\u201cMay I ask, sir, the cause of this accident?\u201d\u201cAn enormous block of ice, a whole ", "35": "mountain, has turned over,\u201d hereplied. \u201cWhen icebergs are undermined at their base by warmer water orreiterated shocks their cen", "36": "tre of gravity rises, and the whole thingturns over. This is what has happened; one of these blocks, as it fell,struck the _Naut", "37": "ilus_, then, gliding under its hull, raised it withirresistible force, bringing it into beds which are not so thick, whereit is ", "38": "lying on its side.\u201d\u201cBut can we not get the _Nautilus_ off by emptying its reservoirs, thatit might regain its equilibrium?\u201d\u201cThat", "39": ", sir, is being done at this moment. You can hear the pumpworking. Look at the needle of the manometer; it shows that the_Nautil", "40": "us_ is rising, but the block of ice is floating with it; and,until some obstacle stops its ascending motion, our position cannot", "41": " bealtered.\u201dIndeed, the _Nautilus_ still held the same position to starboard;doubtless it would right itself when the block stop", "42": "ped. But at thismoment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the twoglassy surfaces? I reflected on all the con", "43": "sequences of our position.Captain Nemo never took his eyes off the manometer. Since the fall ofthe iceberg, the _Nautilus_ had r", "44": "isen about a hundred and fifty feet,but it still made the same angle with the perpendicular. Suddenly aslight movement was felt ", "45": "in the hold. Evidently it was righting alittle. Things hanging in the saloon were sensibly returning to theirnormal position. Th", "46": "e partitions were nearing the upright. No one spoke.With beating hearts we watched and felt the straightening. The boardsbecame ", "47": "horizontal under our feet. Ten minutes passed.\u201cAt last we have righted!\u201d I exclaimed.\u201cYes,\u201d said Captain Nemo, going to the door", "48": " of the saloon.\u201cBut are we floating?\u201d I asked.\u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied; \u201csince the reservoirs are not empty; and, whenempty, the ", "49": "_Nautilus_ must rise to the surface of the sea.\u201dWe were in open sea; but at a distance of about ten yards, on eitherside of the ", "50": "_Nautilus_, rose a dazzling wall of ice.

Here and there were opal shades of wonderfulsoftne", "59": "ss, running through bright spots like diamonds of fire, thebrilliancy of which the eye could not bear.

I often looked at the instruments hanging from thepartition. The manometer showed that the _", "20": "Nautilus_ kept at a constantdepth of more than three hundred yards; the compass still pointed tosouth; the log indicated a speed", "21": " of twenty miles an hour, which, insuch a cramped space, was very great.

Come, Ned!\u201dI led him to the room where the crew of the _Nautilus_ were putting ontheir", "41": " corkjackets. I told the Captain of Ned\u2019s proposal, which heaccepted. The Canadian put on his seacostume, and was ready as soon ", "42": "ashis companions. When Ned was dressed, I reentered the drawingroom,where the panes of glass were open, and, posted near Conseil", "43": ", Iexamined the ambient beds that supported the _Nautilus_. Some instantsafter, we saw a dozen of the crew set foot on the bank ", "44": "of ice, andamong them Ned Land, easily known by his stature. Captain Nemo was withthem. Before proceeding to dig the walls, he t", "45": "ook the soundings, to besure of working in the right direction. Long sounding lines were sunkin the side walls, but after fiftee", "46": "n yards they were again stopped bythe thick wall. It was useless to attack it on the ceilinglikesurface, since the iceberg itsel", "47": "f measured more than 400 yards inheight. Captain Nemo then sounded the lower surface. There ten yards ofwall separated us from t", "48": "he water, so great was the thickness of theicefield. It was necessary, therefore, to cut from it a piece equal inextent to the w", "49": "aterline of the _Nautilus_. There were about 6,000 cubicyards to detach, so as to dig a hole by which we could descend to theice", "50": "field. The work had begun immediately and carried on withindefatigable energy. Instead of digging round the _Nautilus_ whichwoul", "51": "d have involved greater difficulty, Captain Nemo had an immensetrench made at eight yards from the portquarter. Then the men set", "52": " towork simultaneously with their screws on several points of itscircumference. Presently the pickaxe attacked this compact matt", "53": "ervigorously, and large blocks were detached from the mass. By a curiouseffect of specific gravity, these blocks, lighter than w", "54": "ater, fled, soto speak, to the vault of the tunnel, that increased in thickness atthe top in proportion as it diminished at the ", "55": "base. But that matteredlittle, so long as the lower part grew thinner. After two hours\u2019 hardwork, Ned Land came in exhausted. He", "56": " and his comrades were replaced bynew workers, whom Conseil and I joined. The second lieutenant of the_Nautilus_ superintended u", "57": "s.

However, after a lapse of twelve hours, we had only raised ablock of ice one yard thick, on the marked surface, which wa", "62": "s about 600cubic yards!

Was it des", "3": "tined to perish in this icetomb, with all thoseit enclosed? The situation was terrible. But everyone had looked thedanger in the", "4": " face, and each was determined to do his duty to the last.As I expected, during the night a new block a yard square was carrieda", "5": "way, and still further sank the immense hollow. But in the morningwhen, dressed in my corkjacket, I traversed the slushy mass at", "6": " atemperature of six or seven degrees below zero, I remarked that theside walls were gradually closing in. The beds of water far", "7": "thest fromthe trench, that were not warmed by the men\u2019s work, showed a tendencyto solidification.

Butwhen I went on board again, I told Captain Nemo of this gravecomplication", "11": ".\u201cI know it,\u201d he said, in that calm tone which could counteract the mostterrible apprehensions. \u201cIt is one danger more; but I se", "12": "e no way ofescaping it; the only chance of safety is to go quicker thansolidification. We must be beforehand with it, that is al", "13": "l.\u201dOn this day for several hours I used my pickaxe vigorously. The workkept me up. Besides, to work was to quit the _Nautilus_, ", "14": "and breathedirectly the pure air drawn from the reservoirs, and supplied by ourapparatus, and to quit the impoverished and vitia", "15": "ted atmosphere.Towards evening the trench was dug one yard deeper. When I returned onboard, I was nearly suffocated by the carbo", "16": "nic acid with which the airwas filled\u2014ah! if we had only the chemical means to drive away thisdeleterious gas. We had plenty of ", "17": "oxygen; all this water contained aconsiderable quantity, and by dissolving it with our powerful piles, itwould restore the vivif", "18": "ying fluid. I had thought well over it; but ofwhat good was that, since the carbonic acid produced by our respirationhad invaded", "19": " every part of the vessel? To absorb it, it was necessary tofill some jars with caustic potash, and to shake them incessantly. N", "20": "owthis substance was wanting on board, and nothing could replace it. Onthat evening, Captain Nemo ought to open the taps of his ", "21": "reservoirs,and let some pure air into the interior of the _Nautilus;_ without thisprecaution we could not get rid of the sense o", "22": "f suffocation. The nextday, March 26th, I resumed my miner\u2019s work in beginning the fifth yard.The side walls and the lower surfa", "23": "ce of the iceberg thickened visibly.It was evident that they would meet before the _Nautilus_ was able todisengage itself.

Just then Cap", "26": "tain Nemo passed near me. I touched his hand andshowed him the walls of our prison. The wall to port had advanced to atleast fou", "27": "r yards from the hull of the _Nautilus_. The Captainunderstood me, and signed me to follow him. We went on board. I tookoff my c", "28": "orkjacket and accompanied him into the drawingroom.\u201cM.

Do you not see that by its solidification, it would burstthrough this field of ice that imprisons us,", "32": " as, when it freezes, itbursts the hardest stones? Do you not perceive that it would be anagent of safety instead of destruction", "33": "?\u201d\u201cYes, Captain, perhaps. But, whatever resistance to crushing the_Nautilus_ possesses, it could not support this terrible press", "34": "ure, andwould be flattened like an iron plate.\u201d\u201cI know it, sir. Therefore we must not reckon on the aid of nature, buton our own", "35": " exertions. We must stop this solidification. Not only willthe side walls be pressed together; but there is not ten feet of wate", "36": "rbefore or behind the _Nautilus_. The congelation gains on us on allsides.\u201d\u201cHow long will the air in the reservoirs last for us ", "37": "to breathe onboard?\u201dThe Captain looked in my face. \u201cAfter tomorrow they will be empty!\u201dA cold sweat came over me. However, ought", "38": " I to have been astonished atthe answer? On March 22, the _Nautilus_ was in the open polar seas. Wewere at 26\u00b0. For five days we", "39": " had lived on the reserve on board. Andwhat was left of the respirable air must be kept for the workers. Evennow, as I write, my", "40": " recollection is still so vivid that an involuntaryterror seizes me and my lungs seem to be without air. Meanwhile,Captain Nemo ", "41": "reflected silently, and evidently an idea had struck him;but he seemed to reject it. At last, these words escaped his lips:\u201cBoil", "42": "ing water!\u201d he muttered.\u201cBoiling water?\u201d I cried.\u201cYes, sir.

Captain Nemo took me to thegalleys, wh", "45": "ere the vast distillatory machines stood that furnished thedrinkable water by evaporation. They filled these with water, and all", "46": "the electric heat from the piles was thrown through the worms bathed inthe liquid. In a few minutes this water reached 100\u00b0. It ", "47": "was directedtowards the pumps, while fresh water replaced it in proportion.

The injection wa", "49": "s begun, and three hours afterthe thermometer marked 6\u00b0 below zero outside. One degree was gained.Two hours later the thermomete", "50": "r only marked 4\u00b0.\u201cWe shall succeed,\u201d I said to the Captain, after having anxiouslywatched the result of the operation.\u201cI think,\u201d", "51": " he answered, \u201cthat we shall not be crushed.

But, as thecongelation of the seawater produces at lea", "53": "st 2\u00b0, I was at leastreassured against the dangers of solidification.The next day, March 27th, six yards of ice had been cleared", "54": ", twelvefeet only remaining to be cleared away. There was yet fortyeighthours\u2019 work. The air could not be renewed in the interio", "55": "r of the_Nautilus_. And this day would make it worse. An intolerable weightoppressed me.

He took my hand and encouraged me, and Iheard him murmur, \u201cOh! if", "59": " I could only not breathe, so as to leave moreair for my master!\u201dTears came into my eyes on hearing him speak thus. If our situa", "60": "tion toall was intolerable in the interior, with what haste and gladness wouldwe put on our corkjackets to work in our turn! Pic", "61": "kaxes sounded on thefrozen icebeds.

When thetime came, he gave up his apparatus to an"}, "62": {"1": "other and returned to thevitiated air on board, calm, unflinching, unmurmuring.On that day the ordinary work was accomplished wi", "2": "th unusual vigour.Only two yards remained to be raised from the surface.

The next daymy breathing was opp", "5": "ressed. Dizziness accompanied the pain in my headand made me like a drunken man. My companions showed the same symptoms.Some of ", "6": "the crew had rattling in the throat.On that day, the sixth of our imprisonment, Captain Nemo, finding thepickaxes work too slowl", "7": "y, resolved to crush the icebed that stillseparated us from the liquid sheet. This man\u2019s coolness and energynever forsook him. H", "8": "e subdued his physical pains by moral force.By his orders the vessel was lightened, that is to say, raised from theicebed by a c", "9": "hange of specific gravity.

Then, filling his reservoirs of water, he descended andshut himself up in the hole.Just then all the crew came on board, a", "11": "nd the double door ofcommunication was shut.

Notwithstanding the buzzing in my head, I soon heard thehumming sound under the hull", "15": " of the _Nautilus_. The ice cracked with asingular noise, like tearing paper, and the _Nautilus_ sank.\u201cWe are off!\u201d murmured Con", "16": "seil in my ear.I could not answer him. I seized his hand, and pressed it convulsively.All at once, carried away by its frightful", "17": " overcharge, the _Nautilus_sank like a bullet under the waters, that is to say, it fell as if itwas in a vacuum.

Soon, too, the manometer indicated an ascendingmovement. The screw, going at full speed, made the iron hull tremble toits ver", "20": "y bolts and drew us towards the north.

He would thus complete the tour round thesubmarine world, and return to those waters in which the", "52": " _Nautilus_could sail freely. We ought, before long, to settle this importantpoint. The _Nautilus_ went at a rapid pace. The pol", "53": "ar circle was soonpassed, and the course shaped for Cape Horn. We were off the Americanpoint, March 31st, at seven o\u2019clock in th", "54": "e evening. Then all our pastsufferings were forgotten. The remembrance of that imprisonment in theice was effaced from our minds", "55": ". We only thought of the future. CaptainNemo did not appear again either in the drawingroom or on theplatform. The point shown e", "56": "ach day on the planisphere, and, marked bythe lieutenant, showed me the exact direction of the _Nautilus_. Now,on that evening, ", "57": "it was evident, to my great satisfaction, that wewere going back to the North by the Atlantic. The next day, April 1st,when the ", "58": "_Nautilus_ ascended to the surface some minutes before noon,we sighted land to the west. It was Terra del Fuego, which the first", "59": "navigators named thus from seeing the quantity of smoke that rose fromthe natives\u2019 huts. The coast seemed low to me, but in the ", "60": "distance rosehigh mountains. I even thought I had a glimpse of Mount Sarmiento, thatrises 2,070 yards above the level of the sea", "61": ", with a very pointedsummit, which, according as it is misty or clear, is a sign of fine orof wet weather. At this moment the pe", "62": "ak was clearly defined against thesky. The _Nautilus_, diving again under the water, approached thecoast, which was only some fe", "63": "w miles off. From the glass windows in thedrawingroom, I saw long seaweeds and gigantic fuci and varech, ofwhich the open polar ", "64": "sea contains so many specimens, with their sharppolished filaments; they measured about 300 yards in length\u2014realcables, thicker "}, "63": {"1": "than one\u2019s thumb; and, having great tenacity, they areoften used as ropes for vessels. Another weed known as velp, withleaves fo", "2": "ur feet long, buried in the coral concretions, hung at thebottom. It served as nest and food for myriads of crustacea andmollusc", "3": "s, crabs, and cuttlefish. There seals and otters had splendidrepasts, eating the flesh of fish with seavegetables, according to ", "4": "theEnglish fashion. Over this fertile and luxuriant ground the _Nautilus_passed with great rapidity. Towards evening it approach", "5": "ed the Falklandgroup, the rough summits of which I recognised the following day. Thedepth of the sea was moderate. On the shores", "6": " our nets brought inbeautiful specimens of sea weed, and particularly a certain fucus, theroots of which were filled with the be", "7": "st mussels in the world. Geeseand ducks fell by dozens on the platform, and soon took their places inthe pantry on board.When th", "8": "e last heights of the Falklands had disappeared from thehorizon, the _Nautilus_ sank to between twenty and twentyfive yards,and ", "9": "followed the American coast. Captain Nemo did not show himself.Until the 3rd of April we did not quit the shores of Patagonia,so", "10": "metimes under the ocean, sometimes at the surface. The _Nautilus_passed beyond the large estuary formed by the Plata, and was, o", "11": "nthe 4th of April, fiftysix miles off Uraguay. Its direction wasnorthwards, and followed the long windings of the coast of South", "12": "America. We had then made 1,600 miles since our embarkation in the seasof Japan. About eleven o\u2019clock in the morning the Tropic ", "13": "of Capricornwas crossed on the thirtyseventh meridian, and we passed Cape Friostanding out to sea. Captain Nemo, to Ned Land\u2019s g", "14": "reat displeasure,did not like the neighbourhood of the inhabited coasts of Brazil, forwe went at a giddy speed. Not a fish, not ", "15": "a bird of the swiftest kindcould follow us, and the natural curiosities of these seas escaped allobservation.This speed was kept", "16": " up for several days, and in the evening of the 9thof April we sighted the most easterly point of South America that formsCape S", "17": "an Roque. But then the _Nautilus_ swerved again, and sought thelowest depth of a submarine valley which is between this Cape and", "18": "Sierra Leone on the African coast. This valley bifurcates to theparallel of the Antilles, and terminates at the north by the eno", "19": "rmousdepression of 9,000 yards. In this place, the geological basin of theocean forms, as far as the Lesser Antilles, a cliff of", "20": " three and a halfmiles perpendicular in height, and, at the parallel of the Cape VerdeIslands, another wall not less considerabl", "21": "e, that encloses thus allthe sunk continent of the Atlantic. The bottom of this immense valleyis dotted with some mountains, tha", "22": "t give to these submarine places apicturesque aspect. I speak, moreover, from the manuscript charts thatwere in the library of t", "23": "he _Nautilus_\u2014charts evidently due to CaptainNemo\u2019s hand, and made after his personal observations. For two days thedesert and d", "24": "eep waters were visited by means of the inclined planes.The _Nautilus_ was furnished with long diagonal broadsides whichcarried ", "25": "it to all elevations. But on the 11th of April it rosesuddenly, and land appeared at the mouth of the Amazon River, a vastestuar", "26": "y, the embouchure of which is so considerable that it freshensthe seawater for the distance of several leagues.The equator was c", "27": "rossed. Twenty miles to the west were the Guianas, aFrench territory, on which we could have found an easy refuge; but astiff br", "28": "eeze was blowing, and the furious waves would not have alloweda single boat to face them. Ned Land understood that, no doubt, fo", "29": "r hespoke not a word about it. For my part, I made no allusion to hisschemes of flight, for I would not urge him to make an atte", "30": "mpt thatmust inevitably fail. I made the time pass pleasantly by interestingstudies. During the days of April 11th and 12th, the", "31": " _Nautilus_ did notleave the surface of the sea, and the net brought in a marvellous haulof zoophytes, fish and reptiles.

Butthat he was sad and irresolute I could see by the vessel, of wh", "60": "ich hewas the soul, and which received all his impressions. The _Nautilus_did not keep on in its settled course; it floated abou", "61": "t like a corpseat the will of the waves. It went at random.

The _Nautilus_ still went at random; all supervision seemedabandoned. I thought that, under these circumst", "8": "ances, escape would bepossible.

In 1863 the engineers constructed an other one, measuring 2,000miles in l", "48": "ength, and weighing 4,500 tons, which was embarked on theGreat Eastern. This attempt also failed.On the 25th of May the _Nautilu", "49": "s_, being at a depth of more than 1,918fathoms, was on the precise spot where the rupture occurred whichruined the enterprise. I", "50": "t was within 638 miles of the coast of Ireland;and at halfpast two in the afternoon they discovered thatcommunication with Europ", "51": "e had ceased. The electricians on boardresolved to cut the cable before fishing it up, and at eleven o\u2019clockat night they had re", "52": "covered the damaged part.

Captain Anderson, the officers, and engineers consultedtogether, and had it posted up ", "59": "that, if the offender was surprised onboard, he would be thrown without further trial into the sea.

The bottom of the ocean then formed a valley about 100miles broad, in which Mont Blanc might have been placed withou", "8": "t itssummit appearing above the waves.

In rounding the ", "11": "Emerald Isle, for one instant I caught sight ofCape Clear, and the light which guides the thousands of vessels leavingGlasgow or", "12": " Liverpool. An important question then arose in my mind. Didthe _Nautilus_ dare entangle itself in the Manche? Ned Land, who had", "13": "reappeared since we had been nearing land, did not cease to questionme. How could I answer? Captain Nemo remained invisible. Aft", "14": "er havingshown the Canadian a glimpse of American shores, was he going to showme the coast of France?But the _Nautilus_ was stil", "15": "l going southward. On the 30th of May, itpassed in sight of Land\u2019s End, between the extreme point of England andthe Scilly Isles", "16": ", which were left to starboard. If we wished to enterthe Manche, he must go straight to the east. He did not do so.During the wh", "17": "ole of the 31st of May, the _Nautilus_ described a seriesof circles on the water, which greatly interested me. It seemed to bese", "18": "eking a spot it had some trouble in finding. At noon, Captain Nemohimself came to work the ship\u2019s log. He spoke no word to me, b", "19": "ut seemedgloomier than ever. What could sadden him thus? Was it his proximityto European shores? Had he some recollections of hi", "20": "s abandoned country?If not, what did he feel? Remorse or regret?

It was evidently seeking some particular spot in the ocean.Captain Nemo took the sun\u2019s altitude as he had don", "23": "e the day before. Thesea was beautiful, the sky clear.

Some minutesbefore the sun passed the mer", "25": "idian, Captain Nemo took his sextant, andwatched with great attention. The perfect rest of the water greatlyhelped the operation", "26": ". The _Nautilus_ was motionless; it neither rollednor pitched.I was on the platform when the altitude was taken, and the Captain", "27": "pronounced these words: \u201cIt is here.\u201dHe turned and went below. Had he seen the vessel which was changing itscourse and seemed to", "28": " be nearing us? I could not tell. I returned to thesaloon. The panels closed, I heard the hissing of the water in thereservoirs.", "29": " The _Nautilus_ began to sink, following a vertical line,for its screw communicated no motion to it. Some minutes later itstoppe", "30": "d at a depth of more than 420 fathoms, resting on the ground. Theluminous ceiling was darkened, then the panels were opened, and", "31": " throughthe glass I saw the sea brilliantly illuminated by the rays of ourlantern for at least half a mile round us.I looked to ", "32": "the port side, and saw nothing but an immensity of quietwaters. But to starboard, on the bottom appeared a large protuberance,wh", "33": "ich at once attracted my attention.

My companions and I resolved to fly when the vesselshould be near enough either to hear u", "56": "s or to see us; for the moon,which would be full in two or three days, shone brightly.

I", "4": "t was ever nearing thatphosphorescent light which showed the presence of the _Nautilus_. Icould see its green and red lights, an", "5": "d its white lantern hanging fromthe large foremast.

Some stepswere taken which might be called t", "11": "he signal for action. They were verysimple. The iron balustrade around the platform was lowered, and thelantern and pilot cages ", "12": "were pushed within the shell until they wereflush with the deck. The long surface of the steel cigar no longeroffered a single p", "13": "oint to check its man\u0153uvres. I returned to thesaloon.

The Canadian rushed on to the stairs, but Istopped him. A wellknown hissing noise told me that the water wasrunning into the", "21": " reservoirs, and in a few minutes the _Nautilus_ wassome yards beneath the surface of the waves. I understood the man\u0153uvre.It wa", "22": "s too late to act. The _Nautilus_ did not wish to strike at theimpenetrable cuirass, but below the waterline, where the metallic", "23": "covering no longer protected it.We were again imprisoned, unwilling witnesses of the dreadful dramathat was preparing. We had sc", "24": "arcely time to reflect; taking refuge inmy room, we looked at each other without speaking. A deep stupor hadtaken hold of my min", "25": "d: thought seemed to stand still.

I heardrat", "28": "tlings and scrapings. But the _Nautilus_, carried along by itspropelling power, passed through the mass of the vessel like a nee", "29": "dlethrough sailcloth!I could stand it no longer.

At wonderful speed, a hundred feet beneath the water, itwas leaving this desolate spot. Whither was it going? To the north or", "45": "south? Where was the man flying to after such dreadful retaliation? Ihad returned to my room, where Ned and Conseil had remained", "46": " silentenough. I felt an insurmountable horror for Captain Nemo. Whatever hehad suffered at the hands of these men, he had no ri", "47": "ght to punish thus.He had made me, if not an accomplice, at least a witness of hisvengeance. At eleven the electric light reappe", "48": "ared. I passed into thesaloon. It was deserted. I consulted the different instruments. The_Nautilus_ was flying northward at the", "49": " rate of twentyfive miles anhour, now on the surface, and now thirty feet below it. On taking thebearings by the chart, I saw th", "50": "at we were passing the mouth of theManche, and that our course was hurrying us towards the northern seasat a frightful speed. Th", "51": "at night we had crossed two hundred leagues ofthe Atlantic. The shadows fell, and the sea was covered with darknessuntil the ris", "52": "ing of the moon. I went to my room, but could not sleep. Iwas troubled with dreadful nightmare. The horrible scene of destructio", "53": "nwas continually before my eyes. From that day, who could tell into whatpart of the North Atlantic basin the _Nautilus_ would ta", "54": "ke us? Stillwith unaccountable speed. Still in the midst of these northern fogs.Would it touch at Spitzbergen, or on the shores ", "55": "of Nova Zembla? Shouldwe explore those unknown seas, the White Sea, the Sea of Kara, the Gulfof Obi, the Archipelago of Liarrov,", "56": " and the unknown coast of Asia? Icould not say. I could no longer judge of the time that was passing.The clocks had been stopped", "57": " on board. It seemed, as in polar countries,that night and day no longer followed their regular course. I feltmyself being drawn", "58": " into that strange region where the founderedimagination of Edgar Poe roamed at will.

And the Canadian, to"}, "71": {"1": "o, his strength and patience at anend, appeared no more.

The Canadian left me. I reached thepl", "11": "atform, on which I could with difficulty support myself against theshock of the waves. The sky was threatening; but, as land was", "12": " in thosethick brown shadows, we must fly. I returned to the saloon, fearing andyet hoping to see Captain Nemo, wishing and yet ", "13": "not wishing to see him.What could I have said to him? Could I hide the involuntary horror withwhich he inspired me? No. It was b", "14": "etter that I should not meet him faceto face; better to forget him. And yet\u2014\u2014 How long seemed that day, thelast that I should pa", "15": "ss in the _Nautilus_. I remained alone. Ned Landand Conseil avoided speaking, for fear of betraying themselves. At sixI dined, b", "16": "ut I was not hungry; I forced myself to eat in spite of mydisgust, that I might not weaken myself. At halfpast six Ned Land came", "17": "to my room, saying, \u201cWe shall not see each other again before ourdeparture. At ten the moon will not be risen. We will profit by", "18": " thedarkness. Come to the boat; Conseil and I will wait for you.\u201dThe Canadian went out without giving me time to answer. Wishing", "19": " toverify the course of the _Nautilus_, I went to the saloon. We wererunning N.N.E. at frightful speed, and more than fifty yard", "20": "s deep. Icast a last look on these wonders of nature, on the riches of artheaped up in this museum, upon the unrivalled collecti", "21": "on destined toperish at the bottom of the sea, with him who had formed it. I wishedto fix an indelible impression of it in my mi", "22": "nd. I remained an hourthus, bathed in the light of that luminous ceiling, and passing inreview those treasures shining under the", "23": "ir glasses. Then I returned tomy room.I dressed myself in strong sea clothing. I collected my notes, placingthem carefully about", "24": " me. My heart beat loudly. I could not check itspulsations. Certainly my trouble and agitation would have betrayed meto Captain ", "25": "Nemo\u2019s eyes. What was he doing at this moment? I listened atthe door of his room. I heard steps. Captain Nemo was there. He had ", "26": "notgone to rest. At every moment I expected to see him appear, and ask mewhy I wished to fly. I was constantly on the alert. My ", "27": "imaginationmagnified everything. The impression became at last so poignant that Iasked myself if it would not be better to go to", "28": " the Captain\u2019s room, seehim face to face, and brave him with look and gesture.It was the inspiration of a madman; fortunately I ", "29": "resisted the desire,and stretched myself on my bed to quiet my bodily agitation. My nerveswere somewhat calmer, but in my excite", "30": "d brain I saw over again all myexistence on board the _Nautilus;_ every incident, either happy orunfortunate, which had happened", "31": " since my disappearance from the_Abraham Lincoln_\u2014the submarine hunt, the Torres Straits, the savagesof Papua, the running ashor", "32": "e, the coral cemetery, the passage of Suez,the Island of Santorin, the Cretan diver, Vigo Bay, Atlantis, theiceberg, the South P", "33": "ole, the imprisonment in the ice, the fight amongthe poulps, the storm in the Gulf Stream, the Avenger, and the horriblescene of", "34": " the vessel sunk with all her crew. All these events passedbefore my eyes like scenes in a drama. Then Captain Nemo seemed to gr", "35": "owenormously, his features to assume superhuman proportions. He was nolonger my equal, but a man of the waters, the genie of the", "36": " sea.It was then halfpast nine. I held my head between my hands to keep itfrom bursting. I closed my eyes; I would not think any", "37": " longer. Therewas another halfhour to wait, another halfhour of a nightmare, whichmight drive me mad.At that moment I heard the ", "38": "distant strains of the organ, a sad harmonyto an undefinable chant, the wail of a soul longing to break theseearthly bonds. I li", "39": "stened with every sense, scarcely breathing;plunged, like Captain Nemo, in that musical ecstasy, which was drawinghim in spirit ", "40": "to the end of life.Then a sudden thought terrified me. Captain Nemo had left his room. Hewas in the saloon, which I must cross t", "41": "o fly. There I should meet himfor the last time. He would see me, perhaps speak to me. A gesture ofhis might destroy me, a singl", "42": "e word chain me on board.But ten was about to strike. The moment had come for me to leave myroom, and join my companions.I must ", "43": "not hesitate, even if Captain Nemo himself should rise beforeme. I opened my door carefully; and even then, as it turned on itsh", "44": "inges, it seemed to me to make a dreadful noise. Perhaps it onlyexisted in my own imagination.I crept along the dark stairs of t", "45": "he _Nautilus_, stopping at each stepto check the beating of my heart. I reached the door of the saloon, andopened it gently. It ", "46": "was plunged in profound darkness. The strains ofthe organ sounded faintly. Captain Nemo was there. He did not see me.In the full", "47": " light I do not think he would have noticed me, so entirelywas he absorbed in the ecstasy.I crept along the carpet, avoiding the", "48": " slightest sound which mightbetray my presence. I was at least five minutes reaching the door, atthe opposite side, opening into", "49": " the library.I was going to open it, when a sigh from Captain Nemo nailed me to thespot. I knew that he was rising. I could even", "50": " see him, for the lightfrom the library came through to the saloon. He came towards mesilently, with his arms crossed, gliding l", "51": "ike a spectre rather thanwalking.

Thisand some dried", "59": " fruits and a flask of Monte Pulciano, was the bill offare.Dant\u00e8s went on, looking from time to time behind and around about him", "60": ".Having reached the summit of a rock, he saw, a thousand feet beneathhim, his companions, whom Jacopo had rejoined, and who were", "61": " all busypreparing the repast which Edmond\u2019s skill as a marksman had augmentedwith a capital dish.Edmond looked at them for a mo", "62": "ment with the sad and gentle smile of aman superior to his fellows.\u201cIn two hours\u2019 time,\u201d said he, \u201cthese persons will depart ric", "63": "her byfifty piastres each, to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring togain fifty more; then they will return with a fortu", "64": "ne of six hundredfrancs, and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultansand the insolence of nabobs.

He glan", "34": "ced around this second grotto; itwas, like the first, empty.The treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner. The time had", "35": " atlength arrived; two feet of earth removed, and Dant\u00e8s\u2019 fate would bedecided.He advanced towards the angle, and summoning all ", "36": "his resolution,attacked the ground with the pickaxe.

This would have been a favorable occasion to securehis dinner; but Dant\u00e8s feared lest the report of his gun should", "42": " attractattention.He thought a moment, cut a branch of a resinous tree, lighted it at thefire at which the smugglers had prepare", "43": "d their breakfast, and descendedwith this torch.He wished to see everything. He approached the hole he had dug, andnow, with the", "44": " aid of the torch, saw that his pickaxe had in realitystruck against iron and wood. He planted his torch in the ground andresume", "45": "d his labor.In an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared,and Dant\u00e8s could see an oaken coffer, bound with", "46": " cut steel; in themiddle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate, which was stilluntarnished, the arms of the Spada family\u2014", "47": "viz., a sword, _en pale_, onan oval shield, like all the Italian armorial bearings, and surmountedby a cardinal\u2019s hat.Dant\u00e8s eas", "48": "ily recognized them, Faria had so often drawn them for him.There was no longer any doubt: the treasure was there\u2014no one would ha", "49": "vebeen at such pains to conceal an empty casket.

The hing", "54": "es yielded in their turn and fell, still holding intheir grasp fragments of the wood, and the chest was open.0307mEdmond was sei", "55": "zed with vertigo; he cocked his gun and laid it besidehim.

And he measured tendouble handfuls of pearls, diamonds, and other gems, many of which,mounted by the most famous workmen, w", "7": "ere valuable beyond theirintrinsic worth.Dant\u00e8s saw the light gradually disappear, and fearing to be surprisedin the cavern, lef", "8": "t it, his gun in his hand. A piece of biscuit and asmall quantity of rum formed his supper, and he snatched a few hours\u2019sleep, l", "9": "ying over the mouth of the cave.It was a night of joy and terror, such as this man of stupendousemotions had already experienced", "10": " twice or thrice in his lifetime.Chapter 25. The UnknownDay, for which Dant\u00e8s had so eagerly and impatiently waited with openeye", "11": "s, again dawned. With the first light Dant\u00e8s resumed his search.Again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous e", "12": "vening,and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape; butit wore the same wild, barren aspect when seen by t", "13": "he rays of themorning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer ofeve.Descending into the grotto, he lifted the ", "14": "stone, filled his pocketswith gems, put the box together as well and securely as he could,sprinkled fresh sand over the spot fro", "15": "m which it had been taken, andthen carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniformappearance; then, quitting the g", "16": "rotto, he replaced the stone, heapingon it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite,filling the interstic", "17": "es with earth, into which he deftly insertedrapidly growing plants, such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn,then carefully w", "18": "atering these new plantations, he scrupulously effacedevery trace of footsteps, leaving the approach to the cavern assavagelooki", "19": "ng and untrodden as he had found it.

But theirw", "5": "onder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill withwhich Dant\u00e8s handled the helm. The boat, indeed, seemed to ", "6": "be animatedwith almost human intelligence, so promptly did it obey the slightesttouch; and Dant\u00e8s required but a short trial of ", "7": "his beautiful craft toacknowledge that the Genoese had not without reason attained their highreputation in the art of shipbuildi", "8": "ng.The spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as itremained visible; they then turned their conjectures u", "9": "pon her probabledestination.

Dant\u00e8s had carefully noted", "13": " the general appearance ofthe shore, and, instead of landing at the usual place, he droppedanchor in the little creek. The islan", "14": "d was utterly deserted, and boreno evidence of having been visited since he went away; his treasure wasjust as he had left it.Ea", "15": "rly on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches,and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely", "16": " depositedin the compartments of the secret locker.A week passed by.

In acouple of hours he returned. Two of the men from Jacopo\u2019s boat came onboard the yac", "24": "ht to assist in navigating it, and he gave orders that sheshould be steered direct to Marseilles. For his father\u2019s death he wasi", "25": "n some manner prepared; but he knew not how to account for themysterious disappearance of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.Without divulging his secret,", "26": " Dant\u00e8s could not give sufficiently clearinstructions to an agent.

The vision had fled; and as ifthe statues had been ", "38": "but shadows from the tomb, they had vanished athis waking.He advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came, and", "39": "to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality.He found that he was in a grotto, went towards the opening,", "40": " and througha kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky.

Thus every", "49": " now and then he saw in fancy amidthe sailors, seated on a rock, or undulating in the vessel, one of theshadows which had shared", "50": " his dream with looks and kisses.

Franz adjusted histelesco", "59": "pe, and directed it towards the yacht. Gaetano was not mistaken.At the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking tow", "60": "ardsthe shore, and holding a spyglass in his hand. He was attired as hehad been on the previous evening, and waved his pockethan", "61": "dkerchief tohis guest in token of adieu. Franz returned the salute by shaking hishandkerchief as an exchange of signals. After a", "62": " second, a slight cloudof smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel, which rose gracefully asit expanded in the air, and then Fr", "63": "anz heard a slight report.\u201cThere, do you hear?\u201d observed Gaetano; \u201che is bidding you adieu.\u201dThe young man took his carbine and f", "64": "ired it in the air, but without anyidea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated theyacht from the shore.\u201cW"}, "156": {"1": "hat are your excellency\u2019s orders?\u201d inquired Gaetano.\u201cIn the first place, light me a torch.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, I understand,\u201d replied the ", "2": "patron, \u201cto find the entrance tothe enchanted apartment.

He recognized the place where he hadawaked by the bed of heather that", "6": " was there; but it was in vain that hecarried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto. He sawnothing, unless that", "7": ", by traces of smoke, others had before himattempted the same thing, and, like him, in vain.

All was vain; and", "10": " helost two hours in his attempts, which were at last utterly useless. Atthe end of this time he gave up his search, and Gaetano", "11": " smiled.When Franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like asmall white speck on the horizon. He looked again th", "12": "rough his glass,but even then he could not distinguish anything.Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shootin", "13": "ggoats, which he had utterly forgotten. He took his fowlingpiece, andbegan to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is ", "14": "fulfilling aduty, rather than enjoying a pleasure; and at the end of a quarter ofan hour he had killed a goat and two kids. Thes", "15": "e animals, though wildand agile as chamois, were too much like domestic goats, and Franzcould not consider them as game. Moreove", "16": "r, other ideas, much moreenthralling, occupied his mind. Since, the evening before, he hadreally been the hero of one of the tal", "17": "es of the _Thousand and OneNights_, and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto.Then, in spite of the failure of his fi", "18": "rst search, he began a second,after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids. The secondvisit was a long one, and when h", "19": "e returned the kid was roasted and therepast ready.

The Carnival was to commence on themorrow; therefore Albert had not an", "19": " instant to lose in setting forththe programme of his hopes, expectations, and claims to notice.With this design he had engaged ", "20": "a box in the most conspicuous part ofthe theatre, and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions bythe aid of the most ", "21": "rich and elaborate toilet.

Totally disregarding", "28": " the business ofthe stage, he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizingthe beauty of each pretty woman, aided by a ", "29": "powerful operaglass; but,alas, this attempt to attract notice wholly failed; not even curiosityhad been excited, and it was but ", "30": "too apparent that the lovelycreatures, into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing, were allso much engrossed with themse", "31": "lves, their lovers, or their own thoughts,that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of hisglass.The truth was", "32": ", that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival, with the\u201cHoly Week\u201d that was to succeed it, so filled every fair breast, as to", "33": "prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of thestage.

TheTurks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes, butare they not now hideous with their blue frocks butto", "33": "ned up to thechin, and their red caps, which make them look like a bottle of winewith a red seal?

The Count of MonteCristo remained a quarter of an hour with them, conversing on allsubjects with the greatest ease. He was, a", "40": "s we have already said,perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries. Aglance at the walls of his salon proved ", "41": "to Franz and Albert that he wasa connoisseur of pictures. A few words he let fall showed them that hewas no stranger to the scie", "42": "nces, and he seemed much occupied withchemistry. The two friends did not venture to return the count thebreakfast he had given t", "43": "hem; it would have been too absurd to offer himin exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of SignorPastrini. They", "44": " told him so frankly, and he received their excuses withthe air of a man who appreciated their delicacy. Albert was charmedwith ", "45": "the count\u2019s manners, and he was only prevented from recognizinghim for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge.The", "46": " permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him aboveall, for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant car", "47": "riage thepreceding evening, and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footingwith them. At halfpast one they descended, the c", "48": "oachman and footmanhad put on their livery over their disguises, which gave them a moreridiculous appearance than ever, and whic", "49": "h gained them the applause ofFranz and Albert. Albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to hisbuttonhole. At the first sou", "50": "nd of the bell they hastened into theCorso by the Via Vittoria.At the second turn, a bunch of fresh violets, thrown from a carri", "51": "agefilled with harlequins, indicated to Albert that, like himself and hisfriend, the peasants had changed their costume also; an", "52": "d whether it wasthe result of chance, or whether a similar feeling had possessed themboth, while he had donned their costume, th", "53": "ey had assumed his.Albert placed the fresh bouquet in his buttonhole, but he kept thefaded one in his hand; and when he again me", "54": "t the calash, he raised itto his lips, an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fairlady who had thrown it, but her ", "55": "joyous companions also. The day was asgay as the preceding one, perhaps even more animated and noisy; thecount appeared for an i", "56": "nstant at his window, but when they again passedhe had disappeared. It is almost needless to say that the flirtationbetween Albe", "57": "rt and the fair peasant continued all day.In the evening, on his return, Franz found a letter from the embassy,informing him tha", "58": "t he would have the honor of being received by hisholiness the next day. At each previous visit he had made to Rome, hehad solic", "59": "ited and obtained the same favor; and incited as much by areligious feeling as by gratitude, he was unwilling to quit the capita", "60": "lof the Christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feetof one of St. Peter\u2019s successors who has set the rare ex", "61": "ample of allthe virtues. He did not then think of the Carnival, for in spite of hiscondescension and touching kindness, one cann", "62": "ot incline one\u2019s selfwithout awe before the venerable and noble old man called Gregory XVI.On his return from the Vatican, Franz", "63": " carefully avoided the Corso; hebrought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts, to which the madgayety of the maskers would ", "64": "have been profanation.At ten minutes past five Albert entered overjoyed. The harlequin hadreassumed her peasant\u2019s costume, and a"}, "178": {"1": "s she passed she raised her mask.She was charming. Franz congratulated Albert, who received hiscongratulations with the air of a", "2": " man conscious that they are merited.He had recognized by certain unmistakable signs, that his fair_incognita_ belonged to the a", "3": "ristocracy. He had made up his mind towrite to her the next day.Franz remarked, while he gave these details, that Albert seemed ", "4": "to havesomething to ask of him, but that he was unwilling to ask it. Heinsisted upon it, declaring beforehand that he was willin", "5": "g to make anysacrifice the other wished.Albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required, andthen avowed to Fra", "6": "nz that he would do him a great favor by allowing himto occupy the carriage alone the next day. Albert attributed to Franz\u2019sabse", "7": "nce the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask.Franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop Albert in the mi", "8": "ddle ofan adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity andso flattering to his vanity. He felt assured that th", "9": "e perfectindiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened;and as, during three years that he had travelled ", "10": "all over Italy, asimilar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share, Franz wasby no means sorry to learn how to act on ", "11": "such an occasion. He thereforepromised Albert that he would content himself the morrow withwitnessing the Carnival from the wind", "12": "ows of the Rospoli Palace.The next morning he saw Albert pass and repass, holding an enormousbouquet, which he doubtless meant t", "13": "o make the bearer of his amorousepistle. This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw thebouquet (conspicuous by a circ", "14": "le of white camellias) in the hand of acharming harlequin dressed in rosecolored satin.The evening was no longer joy, but deliri", "15": "um. Albert nothing doubted butthat the fair unknown would reply in the same manner. Franz anticipatedhis wishes by saying that t", "16": "he noise fatigued him, and that he shouldpass the next day in writing and looking over his journal. Albert wasnot deceived, for ", "17": "the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantlyshaking a folded paper which he held by one corner.\u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201cwas I mist", "18": "aken?\u201d\u201cShe has answered you!\u201d cried Franz.\u201cRead.\u201dThis word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe.

Albert\u2019slove had not taken away his ", "35": "appetite. He hastened with Franz to seathimself, free to recommence the discussion after dinner. After dinner,the Count of Monte", "36": " Cristo was announced. They had not seen him for twodays. Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him toCivita Ve", "37": "cchia. He had started the previous evening, and had onlyreturned an hour since. He was charming. Whether he kept a watch overhim", "38": "self, or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chordsthat in other circumstances had been touched, he was tonight", "39": " likeeverybody else.The man was an enigma to Franz. The count must feel sure that Franzrecognized him; and yet he had not let fa", "40": "ll a single word indicatingany previous acquaintance between them. On his side, however greatFranz\u2019s desire was to allude to the", "41": "ir former interview, the fear ofbeing disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend withkindness prevented him from ", "42": "mentioning it.The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box atthe Argentina Theatre, and were told they we", "43": "re all let. In consequence,he brought them the key of his own\u2014at least such was the apparentmotive of his visit. Franz and Alber", "44": "t made some difficulty, allegingtheir fear of depriving him of it; but the count replied that, as hewas going to the Palli Theat", "45": "re, the box at the Argentina Theatre wouldbe lost if they did not profit by it. This assurance determined the twofriends to acce", "46": "pt it.Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count\u2019s pallor, which hadso forcibly struck him at their first meeting. He c", "47": "ould not refrainfrom admiring the severe beauty of his features, the only defect, orrather the principal quality of which was th", "48": "e pallor. Truly, a Byronichero! Franz could not, we will not say see him, but even think of himwithout imagining his stern head ", "49": "upon Manfred\u2019s shoulders, or beneathLara\u2019s helmet. His forehead was marked with the line that indicates theconstant presence of ", "50": "bitter thoughts; he had the fiery eyes that seemto penetrate to the very soul, and the haughty and disdainful upper lipthat give", "51": "s to the words it utters a peculiar character that impressesthem on the minds of those to whom they are addressed.The count was ", "52": "no longer young. He was at least forty; and yet it waseasy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whomhe as", "53": "sociated at present. And, to complete his resemblance with thefantastic heroes of the English poet, the count seemed to have the", "54": "power of fascination. Albert was constantly expatiating on their goodfortune in meeting such a man. Franz was less enthusiastic;", "55": " but thecount exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind alwaysacquires over a mind less domineering. He thought sever", "56": "al times of theproject the count had of visiting Paris; and he had no doubt but that,with his eccentric character, his character", "57": "istic face, and his colossalfortune, he would produce a great effect there. And yet he did not wishto be at Paris when the count", "58": " was there.The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres; thatis, not in listening to the music, but in paying ", "59": "visits and conversing.The Countess G\u2014\u2014 wished to revive the subject of the count, but Franzannounced he had something far newer ", "60": "to tell her, and, in spite ofAlbert\u2019s demonstrations of false modesty, he informed the countess ofthe great event which had preo", "61": "ccupied them for the last three days. Assimilar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy, if we may credittravellers, the comtess did", "62": " not manifest the least incredulity, butcongratulated Albert on his success. They promised, upon separating, tomeet at the Duke ", "63": "of Bracciano\u2019s ball, to which all Rome was invited.The heroine of the bouquet kept her word; she gave Albert no sign ofher exist", "64": "ence the morrow or the day after.At length Tuesday came, the last and most tumultuous day of theCarnival. On Tuesday, the theatr"}, "179": {"1": "es open at ten o\u2019clock in the morning,as Lent begins after eight at night. On Tuesday, all those who throughwant of money, time,", "2": " or enthusiasm, have not been to see the Carnivalbefore, mingle in the gayety, and contribute to the noise andexcitement. From t", "3": "wo o\u2019clock till five Franz and Albert followed in the_f\u00eate_, exchanging handfuls of _confetti_ with the other carriages andthe p", "4": "edestrians, who crowded amongst the horses\u2019 feet and the carriagewheels without a single accident, a single dispute, or a single", "5": " fight.The _f\u00eates_ are veritable pleasure days to the Italians. The author ofthis history, who has resided five or six years in ", "6": "Italy, does notrecollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of thoseevents so common in other countries. Albert was", "7": " triumphant in hisharlequin costume. A knot of rosecolored ribbons fell from hisshoulder almost to the ground. In order that the", "8": "re might be noconfusion, Franz wore his peasant\u2019s costume.As the day advanced, the tumult became greater. There was not on thepa", "9": "vement, in the carriages, at the windows, a single tongue that wassilent, a single arm that did not move. It was a human storm, ", "10": "made upof a thunder of cries, and a hail of sweetmeats, flowers, eggs,oranges, and nosegays.At three o\u2019clock the sound of firewo", "11": "rks, let off on the Piazza delPopolo and the Piazza di Venezia (heard with difficulty amid the dinand confusion) announced that ", "12": "the races were about to begin.The races, like the _moccoli_, are one of the episodes peculiar to thelast days of the Carnival. A", "13": "t the sound of the fireworks the carriagesinstantly broke ranks, and retired by the adjacent streets. All theseevolutions are ex", "14": "ecuted with an inconceivable address and marvellousrapidity, without the police interfering in the matter.
